I wish to discern what character our civiliza-\\ntions, now unsteadily merging into a single world civiliza-\\ntion, are destined to take in the foreseeable future, assum-\\ning that we have a foreseeable future. And what can be de-\\nciphered of the roles to be carried by state and church, our\\ntwo institutional interpreters of total human nature. Are\\ntwo needed, the one national, the other world-wide? Are\\nthey to be independent? Is there at the core of our present\\nera of wrath and insecurity an impulse toward a humane\\norder, measurably free from want and fear, in which\\nchurch or state or both might wither away?\\n\\nAs foreview requires, I shall have in mind past move-\\nments of the civilizations eastern and western. There will\\nbe frequent reference to the views of Arnold Toynbee who,\\nas no other historian of our time, has made salient the\\nmajor issues that emerge in interpreting the interaction\\nof civilizations, and in reading the portent of historical\\nchange. Prominent among these issues is that of the sig-\\nnificance of the secularization of modern life, the extrusion\\nof religion, not wholly but from omnicompetence, in\\nscience, law and politics, business, education, the fine arts.\\n\\nNot in opposition to Toynbee, but in some contrast with\\nhim, I shall regard that secularization as an advance,\\nhaving a certain necessity and therefore a degree of per-\\nmanence. Appearing first in the western world, it took\\nshape as a repudiation-in-extent of the claims of western\\n\\nxi\\nxii ENVOI\\n\\nreligion over the major arts of life, Yet, as I read the event,\\nit was less a rejection than a paradoxical offspring of\\nChristianity. And further, the partial de-Christianization\\nof the West brought about by the various secular move-\\nments is destined to work not only to the net advantage\\nof the West, but also to that of a reconceived Christianity.\\nWhile curing western arts of a dependent Christianism, it\\nhas helped to cure Christianity of a hampering western-\\nism, revealing to each its latent universality, and stripping\\nboth for the severe labors of world functions lying before\\nwhatever is universal in art or science or law or religion,\\nand whatever can become universal.\\n\\nAt the same time, this advance, through misunderstand~\\ning its own nature—as is common with revolutionary\\npassages of thought—has brought a deep-seated malaise\\nfrom which we now suffer. I concur with Toynbee that\\namong other matters the spirit of individual liberty, in\\nwhich so much of the greatness of modernity is vested, is\\ntouched with disease. Diagnosis of the malady in all its\\naspects becomes an essential part of any judgment of the\\nprospects for civilization. And diagnoses are now widely\\nbeing offered, many valuable as noting symptoms, none\\nhitherto penetrating to the root of the trouble. It is only\\nthrough accepting the suffering of a genuine but miscon-\\nceived advance, through doing the difficult justice at once\\nto its truth and to its fallacy, that history can find the\\nargument leading to relief. This argument (which as rec-\\nognizing a clear dilemma in the very foundations of\\nmodern life is properly called “dialectic”) will enable it to\\npass out of modernity with its split-mentality into what\\nlies beyond modernity, the era here heralded in whose dawn\\nwe now live.\\nENVOL xiii\\n\\nIn this brief work of forecast there can be no attempt to\\n“cover the ground” of our topic. As befits the temper of\\nprophecy, I must report only what I am privileged to see.\\nThe connective tissue which makes great books must fall\\naway. The theme invites a continent: I can offer but a\\nminor archipelago of say half a dozen islets, with wide\\nwashes of ocean between them. It remains true that what\\none thus fragmentarily sees does not announce itself as\\n“sight” without prior radical analysis. I offer not sporadic\\napergus, but thoughts that chart the forward passage, as\\nan explorer. Let me therefore name the segments of this\\nreport, having at least a submarine continuity, not Vistas\\nnor Chapters, but Studies.\\n\\nThe first of these studies will deal with one phase of that\\nillness of modernity we speak of—a strange powerlessness\\nthat afflicts our majestic institution of public power, the\\npolitical state in its proud amplitude and responsibility.\\nThere follows, as a second study, a tracing of the analysis\\nthrough which this “Impotence of the State” is understood\\nand the “Passage beyond Modernity” indicated.\\n\\nWith regard to this second study, the reader may de-\\nserve a word of comfort. An analysis which finds its way\\nthrough fogs of three centuries’ standing is not necessarily\\neasy; but it is also not abstract—on the contrary, it is the\\ncure of abstraction. Its terminus is, as it must be, an\\nappeal to the experience of every man. The happy pre-\\ncision of Berkeley’s remark applies to our case: “We have\\nfirst raised a dust, and then complain we cannot see!” The\\neffort we must make is an effort to achieve effortless vision :\\nwhatever is supremely true is supremely natural and\\nsimple. But the effort to achieve effortlessness is not wasted\\neffort: it adds to the meaning of what is seen; for the\\nxiv ENVOI\\n\\nCartesian period, however rich in fallacy, is at the same\\ntime the richest so far in human history in the development\\nof tools for human self-understanding and self-mastery.\\nThe analysis which explains its errors is the analysis which\\nalone secures its fruits.\\n\\nThis analysis will serve as a usable clue for unraveling\\nthe knot of destiny in other phases of the civilization now\\nbeing born—in particular, the prospects of the greater\\nreligions of mankind, their relations to one another and to\\nthe emerging common faith.\\n\\nThe welcome arrival of Toynbee’s dn Historian\\'s A p-\\nproach to Religion as these pages are going to press, hence\\ntoo late for specific reference here, will lend an historian’s\\ndimension of concreteness to the issues with which both\\nare concerned, and an added emphasis to their surpassing\\ngravity and actualness.\\n\\nIn some degree, the two volumes, each in its own way\\nconspectus of a life’s work, supplement each other. The\\npresent volume might be said to contain a philosopher’s\\napproach to history. And quite clearly neither Toynbee\\nnor I suppress the impulse to penetrate veiled regions of\\nfuturity. And while we agree that these great issues, in-\\nvolving state, church, secularism, religion, and the possible\\nself-destruction of all civilization, are still in the hands of\\nthe gods, we further agree that there are certitudes attain-\\nable, and that the event will be shaped by the creative\\nvision and courage of mankind.\\n\\nWri1aMm Ernest Hocxiwe\\nMadison, N. H.\\nSeptember, 1956\\nSTUDY I\\n\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF\\nTHE STATE\\n\\ni. The State as Developer of Human Nature\\n\\nWE rey on the political community to do its part in\\nthe making of men, but first of all to furnish the conditions\\nunder which men can make themselves. Through the\\npolitical community human nature reflects upon itself, dis-\\ncovers the long-run effects of impulsive behavior, learns to\\ncurb itself. It gathers the working sense of customs, in\\nwhich the encounter of impulses has reached adjustments\\nworth conserving. Then comes law, as the coinage of\\ncustom consciously criticized, carrying the intrinsic\\nauthority—whatever its nominal source—of this agelong\\ninteraction of primitive drives. Thus, in positive law, the\\nstate sanctions an expression of human nature which\\nhuman nature has first given to the state.\"\\n\\nPrior to and apart from law, the state simply through\\n\\n1 Here I dwell on the truth that human nature must be an active\\npartner in its own evolving. I do not deny that in a degree the state edu-\\neates the man, and is “prior to the individual.” But I observe that there is;\\nno power to educate on the one side, and no right to be educated on the\\nother, apart from the co-operation of the subject. The idea of a “right\\nto an education” as to a commodity transferable from a storehouse to a\\nreceiving mind is one of the current symptoms of decay.\\n\\n1\\n2 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nits continued existence instructs human nature as to its\\nscope. The human will, reasonably or not, concerns itself\\nwith posterity, plans for a future beyond its own life span.\\nThe presence of the continuing state makes such planning\\nrational: placing at the disposal of its members its own\\nwill to endure, the state’s time dimension becomes literally\\ntheirs. This co-operation of state and person makes pos-\\nsible for each individual a will-to-power-through-ideas, an\\nimmortality within human history, in which human ambi-\\ntion may be—we may fairly say—spiritualized.\\n\\n‘Thus through the political community man’s longer will\\ncomes back to him as from an outer source of command.\\nThe natural devotion of the human animal to the visible\\n“community of memory and of hope” carries with it a\\ndocility to personal discipline such as any whole view\\nimposes on sporadic impulse. The state, purely as secular,\\ncomes to be regarded as capable of civilizing the human\\nbeing, and in so doing of remaking him, training his will,\\nmoralizing him.\\n\\nHuman nature has indeed another mirror, and there-\\nwith another source of self-training. It has often been the\\nreligious community—let us call it in all its forms “the\\nchurch”’—which has promised to give the human individual\\nthe most complete view of his destiny and of himself. It\\nprojects that destiny beyond the range of human history.\\nIt speaks for “the whole”—a totality discernible only by\\nthought—and from a presumed ultimate source of right\\nguidance. It provides standards of self-judgment not\\nalone in terms of behavior, as does the law, but also in\\nterms of motive and principle—of the inner man which\\nthe state cannot reach.\\n\\nIn our contemporary world, the secular state tends to\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF THE STATE 8\\n\\nregard itself as the more reliable interpreter of human\\nnature—dealing as it does solely with verifiable experi-\\nence—and as a sufficient interpreter. It speaks, indeed,\\nnot for the cosmos, but for the totality of experience in a\\ncommunity of human beings limited in scope and wisdom ;\\nyet still a community whose experience is typical, and\\nmay fairly be said to represent mankind. Without pre-\\ntending to be the universe, it may speak for the universe\\nso far as human science brings it to our ken.\\n\\nOutside the Marxist orbit, the prevalent disposition of\\nthe secular state in recent years has been less to combat\\nthe church than to carry on a slow empirical demonstra-\\ntion of the state’s full equivalence in picturing the attain-\\nable good life, and its superior pertinence to actual issues.\\nAs this demonstration gains force the expectation grows\\nthat it will be the church, not the state, that will wither\\naway. Where the fields of church and state impinge on\\neach other, as in education and correction, the church will\\nin time appear superfluous. Where they are different, the\\nchurch will be quietly ignored and dropped as irrelevant.\\n\\nI do not regard this tacit appeal to the patient prag-\\nmatic showing of corporate experience as itself irrelevant.\\nTf the state in its secular garb were able to satisfy human\\nnature and succeed in its own work, I should consider that\\ncircumstance—not as proof, but as important evidence\\nthat the secular hypothesis is valid. And this, not because\\nwhatever works is true, but because whatever is not true\\nwill presumably somewhere fail to work,*® whether of scien-\\ntific truth or of truth about the ultimately “real.” For\\nwhatever is real in the universe is no idle object of specula-\\ntive fancy; it is a working factor in experience, or it is\\n\\n2The Meaning of God in Hwman Experience, xiii ff., defining a “nega-\\ntive pragmatism.”\\n4 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nnothing. Consciously or subconsciously we are always deal-\\ning with it: to entertain false ideas about it, or simply to\\nneglect it, will bring about maladjustments which thrust\\nthe neglect forward into consciousness. Contrary to tradi-\\ntional pragmatism, “experience” is incapable of revising\\nour ideas for us; it is, however, fully capable of demanding\\ntheir revision: a false metaphysic, engendering empirical\\nmalaise, calls for a new work of thought begetting an\\naltered premiss. This is the “empirical dialectic,” * a re-\\nsource of newer modes of thinking. It embodies that\\nthoughtful respect for a broadened conception of experi-\\nence which the physical sciences show in their most esoteric\\nreaches: Einstein himself was to the end seeking a way to\\nput his final equations to the experimental test. So is every\\ntrue thinker about the world. So is the state, as thoughtful\\nmolder of men.\\n\\nii. Two Types of Experiment in Secular Polity\\n\\nIn ruts matter of the secular state’s premiss, we have at\\nhand two types of experiment: the explicit experiment of\\nlaique political constitutions in the present century, ex-\\npressly rejecting religion as a factor in political life; and\\nthe unintentional experiment of far longer and wider\\nrange—the experiment we call “medernity.” For modern-\\nity, in begetting a secular science and secular arts, has also\\nincidentally promoted a secular interpretation of state\\nand law, even where the laiqgue plunge has not been taken.\\n\\nOf this former kind of experiment, most thinking per-\\n\\n3% What Man Con Make of Man, 56f. The “empirical dialectic” at once\\nabsorbs and corrects the older pragmatism, which assumed that ex-\\nperience could supplant thought and, as it were, make truth true; and\\nalso disposes of the narrow empiricism of sense-data which logical\\npositivisin has recommended to our time.\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF THE STATE 5\\n\\nsons today have had some knowledge. In a generation or\\ntwo, one with eyes can see a few effects that, within the\\nsocial maze, can be hypothetically attributed to the experi-\\nmental omission—in South and Central America, in the\\nUnited States, in Turkey, in southern and eastern Asia, in\\nthe Marxist world. Here, for example, is a Turkish editor\\nwith eyes, Ahmet Emin Yalman, writing a series of edi-\\ntorials in his daily Vatan in Stamboul during November,\\n1941, on the topic “Toward Clearness.” He notes that “at\\nleast in our great cities a whole generation has grown up\\nwithout any religious influences.” This was in some re-\\nspects “a good thing,” for on the older conceptions of\\nreligion, “religion could not exist without creating a crisis\\nbetween the intelligence of a child and his belief.” And\\nwith a proper education, these religionless young people\\ncan become “more dependable, more moral, and more cor-\\nrect.” But there are those who “become materialistic. . . .\\nThese ridicule the idea of love and of help for others, and\\nconsider selfishness and the seeking of self-interest acts of\\ncleverness. They call theft ‘free gift? and stealing ‘lifting.’\\nThey do not believe that one would consequently suffer for\\none’s doings, neither do they believe that tomorrow will\\nbring any good. They want . . . to have every pleasure\\nthey possibly can. If these young people could benefit from\\nreligion in the ideal sense, they would certainly be better\\nTurks and better human beings. They begin life with a\\nvoid. . . . We feel very keenly that while other nations in\\naddition to their national unity hold on also to their reli-\\ngious unity, we cannot neglect this binding force for our-\\nselves . . . appropriating the religious factor and giving\\nit a clear place in our social life would be the proper course\\nto follow .. . every nation needs to build such a bridge\\nbetween the mind and the feelings. The Moslem religion is\\n6 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmore suitable for this than other religions.” At the head of\\nthis remarkable editorial (Nov. 25, 1941) stands a defini-\\ntion: “The chief role which religion plays is to defeat the\\nfear and anxiety of today, and to give opportunity for\\nbelieving in the good possibilities of the morrow.” *\\n\\nMy own limited observations lead me to think that these\\nbolder experiments have had the virtue of most bolder\\nexperiments: they have shown most clearly that with the\\nclean excision of religion something politically essential\\nhas been lost—without any general agreement as to what\\nthat something is. I might venture to formulate a rude\\nconsensus, chiefly negative, to the following effect: that\\nthe secular state by itself is not enough; that just as eco-\\nnomics can no longer consider itself a closed science, so\\npolitics can no longer consider itself a closed art—the\\nstate depends for its vitality upon a motivation which it\\ncannot by itself command.\\n\\nBut it is with the latter experiment, the experiment of\\nmodernity over three or four hundred years, that I am\\nmost concerned. This experiment, which I have called unin-\\ntentional, as incidental to the outlook creating the ideals\\nof the secular state, has resulted—if I properly read cause\\nand effect—in a radical impotence in the very field of the\\nstate’s own functions, an impotence only now and slowly\\nbut irresistibly becoming evident, less as from a major\\namputation than as from a slight but cumulative malnu-\\ntrition.\\n\\nLet me point out a number of the less noted symptoms\\nof faltering in fields in which the state is expected to act,\\nand has usually acted, with confidence and with a fair\\n\\n«From a translation by J.

We have taken it for granted that the\\n‘state can deal with crime, as its most patent function in\\nsustaining public order. We have believed that it can edu-\\ncate our young. We have assumed that while leaving\\neconomic enterprise largely to its own energies, the state\\ncan cover the failures of the system, protecting individuals\\nfrom destitution, caring for the aged and the ill. We have\\ntaken it as axiomatic that it can make just laws, and pro-\\nvide through a responsible legal profession for their due\\nservice to the people.\\nWe are discovering today, startled and incredulous,\\nthat the state by itself can do none of these things.\\n\\nili. The State’s Touch on Crime and on Education\\n\\nTur state of today is at a loss for a satisfactory—shall\\nwe say technique?—in dealing with crime, violent, crooked,\\nor politely corrupt. It has rational codes, well-graded\\npenalties, elaborate and humane institutions: it is building\\nmore and larger prisons to accommodate the increasing\\ndemand! What better sign of progress? It can apply the\\npenalties. But it cannot punish.\\n\\nFor only the man who has enough good in him to feel\\nthe justice of the penalty can be punished: the others can\\nonly be hurt, or with a finer realism regard themselves as\\ntemporary losers in a game which they may try again. The\\ndegree of goodness that alone can give a penalty the qual-\\nity of punishment is something the state cannot compel.\\nTo put it crudely, only the good man can be punished.\\nAnd he would be better without the penalty—he is pun-\\nished by the judgment.\\n\\nAs for the others, the penalty produces no change of\\nheart. Changes of heart do occur; but it is not the state,\\n8 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nand seldom the event, which effects them. And unless they\\noccur, the state faces a dilemma: either it must set the un-\\nreformed free into the general community—a confession\\nof futility—or it must imprison them for life, at a cost of\\nhuman decay, and of moral strain upon the warding per-\\nsonnel, increasingly abhorrent to all who know its nature.\\nIf God is dead, the totalitarian answer is correct—merci-\\nfully kill the uncompliant. Have we a better answer?\\n\\nThe psychiatrist may suggest abolishing the category\\nof crime, substituting that of disease, and trying a cure.\\nHis premiss is false. But he may be allowed to try, and\\nfor what palliation he may achieve we are grateful, sub-\\nject to the comment that he has evaded or postponed the\\nstate’s issue with the criminal. Nor will the state be easily\\ndeluded by the view that abolishing the category of crime\\nhas, by the simplest of all methods, disposed of crime itself.\\nCriminology rightly suggests that there are scientific in-\\nquiries to be made, and mental conditions to be remedied ;\\nbut as an art founded solely on such a science, it is bank-\\nrupt. Science cannot so much as define the problem of\\ncrime; and the state by itself cannot punish.\\n\\nAs with the dealing with crime, so with education, in\\nwhich broad area the problem of crime is sometimes\\nmerged: here is a function the state must perform, and:\\nwhich the self-sufficient state cannot perform. The as-\\nsumption has been that the modern state can educate not\\nalone the mental person but the volitional person as well.\\nThe state by itself can do neither.\\n\\nAs has been noted, the political community both\\nthrough its laws and through its simple existence always\\naids in the self-formation of its citizens. The modern state,\\nwhether or not avowedly “democratic” always including\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF THE sTATE 9\\n\\nsome degree of popular participation, is peculiarly com-\\nmitted to the belief that education is one of its elementary\\nfunctions and one of its proudest achievements. This belief\\ntends to become a superstition through disregard of the\\ndeep-lying conditions of its partial truth. We are today\\ncompelled to note its fallacy.\\n\\nConsider a mere fraction of the total task, the formal\\neducation of children and youth. The state can build\\nschools, equip them; engage a teaching staff ; organize and\\nsupervise instruction. And ih these systems, education\\nusually takes place: it takes place through the personal\\nqualities of teachers who have in them what the state can\\nneither pay for nor command. Vachel Lindsay, the [linois\\npoet, was a warm proponent of the public school (and so\\nam I); one evening in Beloit, where he had been reading\\nhis poetry to high school students, he put the matter to me\\nin this way: “In every primary school of, say, a dozen\\nteachers, there will be one who wakes the children up.\\nAnd that is enough—for, once wakened, they stay awake!”\\nThis comment exhibits my point: into the net of the\\npolitical requirement there happen the genuine spirits who\\neducate. But the political requirement neither produces\\nthem, nor tends to select and encourage them. What they\\ndo is not literally done by the state.\\n\\nEspecially, in so far as an early cultivation of will and\\ncharacter (a matter in which the home was once the main\\nreliance) devolves upon the schools, can the state provide\\ntraining for teachers? And can it examine and certify\\ntheir qualifications? It is like asking whether the state can\\ncertify that the teachers have a soul! In a community of\\nnormal homes, it has been possible to take a chance on the\\nstatistical presence of the unexaminable quality. The\\nchances appear to diminish. But in any case, it is clear\\n10 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthat it is not the state which provides that quality, nor\\ncan it, The state, on its own resources, cannot educate. Let\\nit magnify without limit its immense volumetric enter-\\nprise: its result will still be that of blowing hurricanes\\ninto a cracked flute.\\n\\niy. The State’s Touch on Family and on Economy\\n\\nI say little of the family. It is the family that stands to\\nbe most immediately sensitive to change in the general\\natmosphere of living, such change as humanistic modern-\\nity introduced, with its spirit of personal freedom, right-\\nful natural enjoyment, experimental deviation and eman-\\ncipation from taboo obsessions. These matters profoundly\\nconcern the state; but the state makes no pretense to\\ninform the family of the life standards of its own institu-\\ntion—it is not directly responsible if there are signs of\\ndisintegration. If there are rising percentages of divorce,\\nif the “tandem polygamies” of Hollywood provide new\\nideals of floating sex association for a self-indulgent com-\\nmunity, if parents fail to convince an arriving generation\\nof the reality of principles they verbally recommend, these\\nare phenomena whose causes the state cannot reach.\\n\\nThe state can establish legal forms for family life, can\\nprotect its privacy, can ease through law some of its more\\ntangible strains. But it knows that the life of the home, a\\ngenerator of morale for every social activity including\\nthat of the state, must be its own. No power can undertake\\nto create where creation itself is at home; no power can\\nmend by law where the spirit of creative love falters. The\\npatriarchal state employed the family bond for its own\\nends ; the territorial state, resigning this resource, is help-\\nless to command it. On the contrary, it frequently finds it\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF THE STATE 11\\n\\nserviceable to reverse the dependence, and revive a lan-\\nguishing esprit de corps for itself by invoking the atmos-\\nphere of the family—if only by the artifice of the radio\\n“fireside chat” or by the substantial institution of the\\n“royal line’”—in the relation of government to governed.\\nNominally the family is included within the state; morally,\\nthe bond of man to the state is included within, and re-\\nmains a pensioner upon, the vital bond of man to nature\\nand all life which is the family. Where there are no\\nfamilies, there can be no state.\\n\\nIn respect to the economic impulses of labor, acquisi-\\ntion, saving, the state, while far less helpless, is in a similar\\nsituation. Like the basic impulses to family life, so the\\neconomic impulses may be credited to nature; and as\\nThomas Aquinas (using the very language of Roman jur-\\nists) included the family impulses within the lew naturae\\nas implanted by God and justified by their own existence,\\nso the modern state tends to assume the economic energies\\nas given, endlessly self-renewing, and self-justified. The\\nstate may shape and canalize the native dispositions—it\\ncannot supply them if they are absent.\\n\\nIt cannot, for example, of indolent human clay produce\\nan industrious society. There are no bitterer chapters in\\nthe history of man’s cruelty to man than those burdened\\nwith the effort to compel tropical man into the pattern of\\nstrenuous northern races. Here, race is and remains\\ntragically important, and equalitarian ideals go blind if\\nthey try to override it, rather than work beneath it.\\n\\nAt the same time, state intrusion is not as in the case of\\nthe domestic impulses a violation; the economic energies\\nare of tougher substance and admit legal molding. And\\nwhile the western states led by England have been dis-\\n12 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nposed for two centuries to a minimum of such molding,\\nand have experimented with an economic near-autonomy,\\nthey have discovered that to assume the natural integrity\\nof unleashed economic motives confronts the community\\nwith nonpolitical powers that ultimately challenge its own\\nsovereignty. Neither can economic science solve its prob-\\nlems without reference to a wider psychology, an ethic,\\neven a metaphysic; nor can an economic art proceed on\\nthe pure maxim that business is business. When the still\\nunsolved problem of distribution appears as an issue of\\njustice, the state can no longer plead nonjurisdiction.\\nAnd just at this point, where it must act in behalf of its\\nown standard, accepting responsibility for the spread of\\nwell-being in terms of the standard of living, and finding\\nmarked success, it becomes aware again of the limit of its\\nability. It can neither insure that “prosperity” will bring\\ncontent, nor that labor itself will be, as it normally is, a\\nsource of satisfaction. Since the drive for material well-\\nbeing is capable of expansion without assignable limit, and\\nsince the disposition to invidious comparison is constantly\\nwhetted by social images of “success,” the very advance of\\neconomic welfare may become a factor of enlarging dis-\\ncontent. As for labor, the will to give less and less in terms\\nof time and effort for a given real-wage continues—as an\\nartefact of social relations in production—to contaminate\\nthe natural joy of the instinct of workmanship. For such\\nself-generated miasmas of motivation the western political\\ncommunity has no medicine. Still less is there cure in that\\ngreat eastern community professedly of, by, and for labor,\\nin which the most extensive form of punishment is—labor ;\\nand in which contentedness with one’s lot is, in effect, a\\nstatutory requirement, enforced by the police. The one\\nspot in all economies in which the natural joy in work is\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF THE STATE 13\\n\\nall but inextinguishable, namely, agriculture, is the spot\\nin which the omnipotent state is now having the most\\nradical difficulty, that of maintaining the morale and\\nhence the productivity of the collective farms.\\n\\nThe modern state can neither leave economy to its own\\nplay of forces, nor take over its control with success. For\\neconomic energies have their norms, their rights and\\nwrongs, partly intrinsic to themselves, partly from general\\nethics, but partly also from the world view of man and the\\nmeaning of his total work, his life’s yield; and this mean-\\ning the state can neither give nor take away.\\n\\nv. The State’s Touch on Recreation\\n\\nBur there is another field in which the impotence of the\\nstate to control its own moral sources is most strikingly\\nmanifest. While easily overlooked as trivial or incidental,\\nit is of vast importance. I refer to the obverse of labor, the\\noccupations of idle hours, the arts of play and the plays of\\nart, the amusements, the prevailing notions of “a good\\ntime.” ° Play is the peculiar realm of freedom, and for this\\nreason a fair diagnostic of what the free man fancies his\\nfreedom is for! What, pray, is freedom for if not for a\\ngood time?\\n\\nNominally, the function of this freedom is recreation,\\nthe unbending of the bow, the renewal of the level of\\npotential energy. But if instead it tends to dissipation, a\\nrunning down without recharging, it is still our liberty\\nand our pursuit of happiness; and the state is there, is it\\nnot, to protect these sacred rights? Who is licensed to\\n\\n* Lecky, in his History of European Morals, calls “the extinction of the\\ngladiatorial spectacles” at Rome after av. 404 an event “upon which the\\nhistorian can look with the deepest and most unmingled satisfaction.”\\nVol. II, 40.\\n14 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ninstruct us how to enjoy ourselves? Let the state step in to\\nmonitor our good times, or to control the commercial pur-\\nveyors of our good times, and there is immediate outery in\\nthe name of the First Amendment, or of some other\\ncharter of liberty.\\n\\nShall not the playhouse present what the publie will\\npay to see? Shall not the publisher be protected in his\\nfreedom to print what the public will buy ; his freedom, for\\nexample, to degrade the souls of children through violent,\\nlurid, smutty “comics”? What are the souls of a few chil-\\ndren as compared with his right to make money as his\\nreaders please? If the state draws a line indicating what\\nis decent to print, and then tries to police the line, it will\\nin all probability pile up publicity along the border and\\nmake the regulation ridiculous. What experience seems\\nto show is that both censorship and no-censorship are\\nfailures: stalemate! If there is in the hearts of the people\\nno revulsion from the degrading of leisure and relaxation,\\nthe state alone—and especially the democratic state—can\\ndo little more than wring its hands, or more probably\\nshrug its shoulders.\\n\\nThe dilemma is real. Laissez faire is acquiescence in slow\\ndisintegration of the texture of social life. Yet law cannot\\nact without defining its targets, and the integrities of art\\nand of play elude legal definitions, The effort to explain\\nand defend dignity lets dignity down. The state is indeed\\nnot without resources other than law. It may enter the\\nfield, as many a municipality has done, with the counter-\\nattractions of decent play, music, public dance. It may\\ncreate recreation grounds, state and national parks and\\nforest reserves. It may, even in democratic regimes, at-\\ntempt the traditional role of aristocracy—selective en-\\ncouragement of the nobler arts, as in the Arts Council of\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF THE STATE 15\\n\\nGreat Britain. It may, in its basic law, reserve to some\\nauthority the power of discretionary and summary action.\\nGreat Britain can act “to protect the youth of the country\\nfrom the influence of certain harmful publications”—as\\nin the Queen’s address to Parliament of May 6, 1955—by\\nprohibiting their import, which is a perfect answer, being\\na mode of the one fit penalty—exile. The degrader should\\nnot be killed; he should be put out of the country, or kept\\nout, With like action by all civilized lands, he would dis-\\ncover his due place.\\n\\nThe modern state has forfeited one great advantage of\\nthe older political communities—the public force of a\\nsense of honor: “honor” being definable as a respect for\\nthe undefinable and unprotectable obligation. And as long\\nas honor has no public power, our civilization is not yet\\ncivilized. The state alone cannot civilize.\\n\\nvi. The State’s Dilemma in Respect to Law\\n\\nMy Frat comment concerns the most intimate and\\nparadoxical field of the state’s helplessness, the field of law\\nitself.\\n\\nThe proposition that law is what the sovereign com-\\nmands is not a nineteenth-century proposal fathered by\\none John Austin: it is the eternal form of law. All actual\\nlaw is positive; and all positive law is uncomfortable if\\nit is asserted that the sovereign lawgiver is bound by\\nstandards external to himself. Yet it belongs to modernity\\nto make this declaration, and to assert that these stand-\\nards are to be found not merely in “nature” as lea natur-\\nalis, but in the human individual as “rights of man.” The\\nbasis of civil law becomes a pledge of the power of all to\\nsecure the rights of each—rights unmodifiable not only by\\n16 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe state but by the subject himself. They are “unalien-\\nable.” The history of jurisprudence in the nineteenth\\ncentury is one of continued and varied protest against the\\nlegal impossibilities created by this revolutionary concep-\\ntion, the essence of modern freedom.\\n\\nWe are concerned with but one phase of this illuminat-\\ning struggle, not yet concluded—the inability of any state\\nto administer a code of rights defined as unconditional,\\nand the simultaneous inability of any state to administer\\nthe necessary conditions. All legal rights assume an inner\\nlawfulness of disposition on the part of the subject of\\nthose rights; let us call it “good will.” The presence of\\nthis good will is the implied condition of every right—\\nthere are no unconditional rights. There is no moral right\\nto property, to liberty, to life itself, in the absence of good\\nwill. The dilemma of the state is that this condition, as a\\nmoral condition, cannot be legally administered: there\\nis no legal way to determine its presence or absence. For\\nthis reason, the condition is not made a part of the Bills\\nof Rights: it is simply assumed to be present.\\n\\nAnd as long as the political morale of the community is\\nin good health, the assumption is satisfactory, with the aid\\nof a few statutory provisions guarding against the more\\ntangible abuses of liberty, as slander, sedition, disorder,\\net cetera.

Analysis of the Source of Impotence”\\n7 ;\\n\\nIn worre these aspects of deficiency of power on the\\npart of the all-powerful modern state, I am not sounding\\na litany of defeat. I do not believe in defeat. I look for no\\nUntergang, no going under of the western world. A radical\\nanalysis of the problem is simply the first requirement for\\nfinding a remedy.\\n\\nTn every inadequacy we have noted, the state’s incapac-\\nity arises from a failure of the motivation it has hitherto\\nbeen able to asswme in its public. And since political\\nsociety is essentially an organization of human wills,\\nmotivation is of its essence, This bare proposal is all but\\naxiomatic; but the nature of this motivation and the\\nsources of its health are not to be read from the surface of\\nthings.\\n\\nUntil recently the psychology of political motivation\\nhas been swiftly disposed of by the theorists. In modern\\npolitical thought, the issue emerged in the guise of a “con-\\ntract,” social or governmental, as expressing the quid pro\\nquo offered by Leviathan for the costs of his demands, or\\n18 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nas Rousseau’s apology for the “chains” of civility and law.\\nIn whatever form, these mythical bargains expressed what\\nthe writer considered a necessary preference of intelligent\\nmankind for the restraints of the state, in full view of its\\ncosts. But a necessary preference can easily sink back into\\nthe subconsciousness from which the theorist evoked it.\\nThe average man has been innocent of his sagacious bar-\\ngain, and the modern state has simply assumed “normal\\nhuman motivation”—in brief, political common sense. The\\ncontingency that the habitual obedience which Austin’s\\nsovereign could count on might be sapped as by some\\nchronic anemia has not earlier been contemplated, and\\nhence not guarded against.\\n\\nOn the contrary, modernity, favoring the specialization\\nof functions, has tended to encourage the separation of\\nthe work of law not alone from morals and religion, but\\nfrom feeling itself. If Kant is right, the state should ex-\\nclude motivation from its concern: his central precept of\\nlaw, Handle auesserlich so . . —Behave externally\\nso... .”, is in intended contrast with the imperative of\\nmorality. Law can require that a debt be paid; but\\nwhether from principle, from business prudence, or from\\na wish to shine, law neither specifies nor inquires. Indeed,\\nfew things so embarrass legal procedure as the occasional\\nnecessity for inquiring into motive or intention.\\n\\nNow while Kant is right that the techniques of adminis-\\ntering law make it necessary for legal definitions to be\\nframed in terms of behavior, and not of the heart; and\\nwhile he has won much favor in later jurisprudence for his\\nrecognition of this distinction; it is equally clear that he\\nhas been misled into an impossible separation. There is\\nnothing on which a free state so much depends as on assent\\nof its people. And as for states that make no boast of\\nTHE IMPOTENCE OF THE STATE 19\\n\\ninner freedom, there is still a minimal morale of consent\\nwithout which no state can long survive. The police state\\nis a sick state, on the way to death. Since legal definitions\\nmust be outward, all the more must their implementation\\nbe sustained by the constant gift of bona fides: the cynical\\nquery, quis custodiet ipsos custodes, may typify the nec-\\nessarily unguarded gate in every political order where\\nthe issue of life or death for the state is in the hand of an\\nuncommandable loyalty.\\n\\nAnd my thesis is that modernity has touched western\\nmankind with some wand that affects this minimal political\\nmorale; and that it is the same wand that has evoked the\\nmiracle of modern liberty.\\n\\nFor modernity is in principle an alteration in human\\nself-consciousness; it has received new light as to the\\ncentral certitude of the I-think, and therewith as to the\\nimport of the individual human ego. It has accepted the\\nethical note corresponding to this certitude, that of the\\ncentrality of the ego that feels, desires, acts. The legal\\ncertitudes of the modern era, inheriting from Roman and\\nmedieval sources the notion of subjective rights, have\\nframed themselves not on the wide pattern of a common\\nnature, as with Aquinas, but on the subjective pattern of\\nthe separable ego-substances of Descartes. The “natural\\nrights” are now perquisites of the individual. And this\\nnew light is, in the main, a valid light. Every broad ad-\\nvance in civilization must include a deepening of subjec-\\ntive sensitivity, from which source all invention, all the\\nfertilizing compassions, all art, poetry, prophecy, must be\\nwatered. The spiritual world of modernity, making salient\\nthe moral individual who contains society in himself, and\\ncan stand against all corporate dictation, has a still unex-\\nhausted invitation to greatness,\\n20 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThis belief is wholly consistent with the judgment that\\nmodernity has largely lost the way to ripen the fruit of its\\ngenius; and that political life is one of the first sufferers.\\nIt is in the nature of the empirical dialectic that it is the\\nadvance that carries the germ of malady. For a deepening\\nof subjectivity, which enhances sensitivities toward all\\nexperiences of good, may at the same time obscure a\\ndimension of every good whatever. I shall now examine\\nthis, the crucial point.\\nSTUDY II\\n\\nPASSAGE BEYOND\\nMODERNITY:\\n\\nTHE POSSIBLE UNIVERSALITY\\nOF SOLITUDE\\n\\ni. Modern Subjectivity as Resource and as Threat\\n\\nTuar best fruit of modernity, the free individual dis-\\nposed to stand alone against corporate dictation—what is\\nhe standing for? and what is he standing on?\\n\\nHe is standing for his right. But note: he is not stand-\\ning for his private interest under the specious flag of “my\\nright”; for what he claims as his right he claims for all\\nothers similarly placed. This is the precise difference be-\\ntween an interest and a right. Further, for the justice of\\nhis claim he is prepared to call others—disinterested—to\\nwitness. What gives him his footing is the circumstance\\nthat this for-others-also situation is at least subcon-\\nsciously a known situation—known by these others, known\\nalso by the corporate being addressed; and that he, the\\nclaimant, knows that it is known. He seems to “stand alone”\\n—that is his repute; but does he? Examine closely the\\nbasis of that strange inner certitude of his: how does he\\nknow that his situation is known? His aloneness reaches\\nstrands far beyond himself. I venture to call the ground\\n\\n21\\n22 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\non which he stands a vein of nonsolitude of the “solitary”\\nego.\\n\\nTt is the same nonsolitude as that on which Descartes\\nwisely and inconsistently acted when, having lighted on\\nthe solitary I-exist as his ultimate certitude—meaning for\\nhim I-Descartes-exist—he published it to the world as the\\nbasis for all future philosophy ! What a load for a private\\ncertitude to carry! He instinctively sensed what his\\nmethod could not justify: namely, that his private certi-\\ntude was everyman’s certitude in kind. It had an irrepres-\\nsible universality, At the extreme depth of his inwardness\\nhe joins an infinite outside.\\n\\nHe thus refuted in action the theoretical solipsism de-\\nrivable from his premisses, but without noticing that he\\nhad done so. This solipsism has haunted modernity; and\\nmodernity has also failed to notice its direct refutation in\\nDescartes’ act. Stirred by his enlightening certitude,\\nmodernity has followed him gladly into his subjective\\ndepths, from which it has drawn wondrous harvests. We\\nhave had the monads of Leibniz, the subjective idealisms,\\nall the idealisms that draw objects from pure subjects, the\\ninturned romanticisms, and at last the prevailing and all-\\nabsorbing psychologisms. All-absorbing, for am not I, the\\nnature-made self, the thinker of all my thoughts? And can\\nany thought of mine escape the coloring of my subjectiv-\\nity, my pathology, my subconscious drifts and eddies,\\nknown only to God, and the psychologist or the psycho-\\nanalyst?\\n\\nMust we not have, therefore, as the perfecting enlight-\\nenment, a psychology of all the sciences—a psychology of\\neconomics (like Marshall’s), of the judicial process (like\\nCardozo’s), of religion (in many versions)—yes, of phi-\\nlosophy also (for has not Jaspers proposed a psychology\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 23\\n\\nof philosophical varieties?), even of logic (for are not our\\npragmatisms, our instrumentalisms and operationalisms, a\\nsort of psychology of thinking?) and hence of physics\\nitself (as in Bridgman’s essays)? Should I hesitate to\\npropose a psychology of psychology? Just this was offered\\n\\n’ to the public, when the Plebs textbooks, issued in London\\nin the twenties, announced in the preface of their text on\\npsychology that it would be a class-conscious production\\n—not guilty of the vice of “objectivity”! Must not our\\nvery standards of truth and right—and most obviously, of\\nbeauty—hbe infected with the relativity and warping of the\\ndisparate egos, whose problem of togetherness Kant him-\\nself never squarely faced?\\n\\nWith this splendid and not infertile depth of inbound\\nseparation, the wholeness of man’s conscious world is\\nquietly resigned. Alienation from the total-and-real in its\\nunity for all men is aided by the equally wide acceptance\\nof Descartes’ complementary doctrine, that physical\\nnature is a process of mathematical perfection which we\\nmust conscientiously regard as empty of all purpose and\\nquality: between man and that physical world-total no\\npossible sympathy.\\n\\nAnd with this abandonment of man’s native rapport\\nwith the whole, the nerve of worth in his own living and\\nacting silently ceases to function. Here, I venture to think,\\nis the root of our malady.\\n\\nFor this is the first principle of human motivation: that\\nmeaning descends from the whole to the parts. The second\\nprinciple is that meaning ascends from the parts to the\\nwhole, the inductive element of value. In every task, the\\ndetail sheds its satisfaction or dissatisfaction upward.\\nDriving a nail well is surely an end in itself and sends its\\nitems of cheer to the task in hand. But in this continuous\\n24 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntwo-way traffic, the significance of the whole has the decid-\\ning voice. It can override many an irksome detail, whereas\\nwithout it detailed triumphs lose their charm. The worth\\nof living must indeed have its moment-by-moment verifica-\\ntion—total and distant objectives are not enough—but if\\none lives determinedly in the present in order to forget\\nthat there is no ultimate objective, the nerve is cut.\\n\\nIn childhood, whole-awareness is unquestioned and\\nlatent; it exists as a pervading will-to-live-and-grow-up\\nin a world credited with wisdom as a firm possession ; under\\nthis canopy, the joy of doing is carried by plural pleasure\\ngoals kindly proposed by nature. As we mature, this latent\\nwhole-awareness presents claim as a restless query, cui\\nbono, a demand for total significance, as needed to sustain\\nthe worth of nature’s continuing gift. Normally, this de-\\nmand is met by one’s native sense of continuity with the\\ncommunity, assuming unreflectively—as Descartes did—\\nthe implicit universality of one’s private motivation, in the\\nnaive faith that one’s world is a common world, and that\\none’s private purposes may simply interweave with the\\nongoing purposes of that community, and with the dim\\nworld purpose which the unrelenting forward-leaning\\nspirit of that community foreshadows. Participating in\\nthis thought totality, the meaning of the whole descends\\nupon the part.\\n\\nBut what if it occurs to me that this is, after all, only\\nsomething that “I-think”? What if my naive faith is pre-\\ncisely contradicted by my philosophy, which assures me\\nthat there is no such thing as a genuine community of\\nmind? What if this faith is explicitly rejected by the\\nmoving and triumphant science-and-world-view of the\\nage? Then it is, I say, that the sails of one’s will begin to\\nflop in a failing breeze. The springs of motivation shift\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 25\\n\\ntheir balance; nature’s ostensible pluralism of private\\ngoods tends to resume sway. In particular, that individual\\ndisposed to stand alone for his right reflects that he has\\nno ground to stand on: for no one can stand on what may\\nbe an insufferable projection of one’s private pathology.\\nThe very notion of legal right threatens to yield place to\\nan attempted calculus of interests.’\\n\\nIt is indeed the principle of our advance that has car-\\nried the germ of our malady. Deprived of its natural and\\nresponsible objectivity, our individualism begins to show\\nits capacity to disintegrate, even in youth. And, as an in-\\ncident, a generation of educators in America seeking a\\ncorrective is thrown into a mad attempt to make education\\nequivalent to “life adjustment,” meaning thereby an arti-\\nficial collectivizing of the mentality of the young, under\\nthe name of “democracy.”\\n\\nii. The Dilemma of Modernity; the Struggle\\nwith Solipsism\\n\\nOur situation today is a dilemma. On the one hand, we\\ncannot repudiate the principle of advance, the subjec-\\ntivity that has given us the modern individual and his\\nright. And for this reason we cannot, with Descartes and\\nunreflective mankind, simply assume the universality of\\nour private experience. On the other hand, without that\\n\\nuniversality, no wholeness and no integration of will.\\nBecause of this dilemma, we cannot end our argument\\nby proposing simply a return to the religious element in\\n\\n1 See, for example, Roscoe Pound, Introduction to Philosophy of Law,\\n92.99. Without yielding the field to nineteenth-century social utilitarian-\\nism, Dean Pound credits it with “compelling us to give over the ambigu-\\nous term ‘right’\" His own substitute is derived from the normal\\nexpectancies within a given civilization.\\n26 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe premodern civilization. We may indeed infer that reli-\\ngion is essential, and this has often been taken as the end\\nof the matter. Religion contains the needed element of\\nunion with the whole—this is little more than a truism, for\\nwhatever unites the soul of man with the whole is religion,\\n\\nAnd herewith we answer at once a question which was\\nearly before us: it is clearly not the destiny of the secular\\nstate to render the functions of a religious community\\nsuperfluous. On the contrary, with the advance of a tech-\\nnical civilization, a church in our broad sense (assuming\\nthat it does its work and nothing but its work) instead of\\ntending to wither away, becomes increasingly necessary to\\nthe vitality of the state, its function being to maintain\\nthat integrity of motivation which the state requires and\\ncannot of itself elicit or command. This conclusion I re-\\ngard as valid and important.\\n\\nBut taken as a summons to return to a status quo ante,\\nit cannot be sufficient, unless we regard modernity as\\na false step. If we believe, as I certainly do, that the ad-\\nvances of modernity are genuine, and must enter into the\\nbody of whatever faith mankind can hold, we cannot dis-\\nregard modernity’s philosophical quandaries. Philosophy\\nis the good faith of Faith with human thought. The issues\\nraised by philosophy must have an answer for reason as\\nwell as for intuition. Faith itself will be affected by what\\nwe here require—a new advance of thought which, without\\nlosing the modern depth of subjectivity, can give us a\\nrational right to our “naive assumption” of the universal-\\nity of our private experience.\\n\\nIn the search for a releasing insight, modernity has been\\nheld fast by its own postulates—among them this, that\\nwhat is subjective cannot at the same time be shared; there\\nis no such thing as a literal awareness by one mind of\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 27\\n\\nanother mind. The other’s selfhood can certainly not be\\nsensed, nor can another’s experience be experienced as he\\nexperiences it. The first person plural, “we,” is half\\nhypothesis. When you and I look at “the same object,”\\nall I surely know is that I look at it, and suppose there\\nis a “you” who does the same. In brief, there is no genuine\\nconsubjectivity (or as it is commonly referred to, no\\n“intersubjectivity”) for a scrupulous modern empiricism:\\nthe word “we” is a trap for the unwary!\\n\\nHence when my colleague Whitehead, in one of our\\njoint seminars, throws out in an amiable aside, “Hang it\\nall! Here we are: we don’t go behind that, we begin with\\nit,” he has implicitly brushed aside one of the theoretical\\nbases of modernity. He speaks the common sense of man-\\nkind; and in my judgment he is entirely right. But to\\njustify the stroke, we must explicitly alter the bases of our\\nepistemology.*\\n\\nIn practice, each individual mind, having its unique per-\\nspective of a world, includes therein its fellow minds: each\\nbelieves in the existence of his fellows. There are no\\nsolipsists-by-belief, Yet, on Descartes’ ground, which is\\nmodernity’s, we must all, with Leibniz and Bertrand Rus-\\nsell, be solipsists-in-theory. As Kant has perfectly put the\\nmatter, “The I-think must be able to accompany (and\\nswallow) all my Vorstellwngen”—all my ideas and perceiv-\\nings. On this point, Leibniz alone is fully consistent (and\\nmore resolutely consequent than Kant, who evaded the\\nissue of the “we”): minds are monads, each with an im-\\npenetrably private world panorama unrolling, not before\\nhim, but in him.\\n\\n21 have discussed this point at length in “Marcel and the Ground\\n\\nIssues of Metaphysics,” Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,\\nJune, 1954, 447 F\\n28 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nCould there be such a thing as a veritable consubjectiv-\\nity whereby one self participates, not by imaginative or\\nsympathetic construction, but by actual experience, in the\\nselfhood of another? Could this be the case without de-\\nstroying the privacy of the ego, so that our physical\\nworld, for example, could be literally a common world, and\\nknown as such, without any intrusion of person on person?\\nIf that were the case, we should see and judge things with\\na natural universality. The solitary experimenter would\\nknow (as he spontaneously assumes) that his results must\\nbe confirmed by everyone who follows the experiment\\nunder the same conditions: a universal science would be\\njustified. Each man would be, not merely an I-think, but\\nman-thinking. This, I submit, seems to be not only the true\\nstate of affairs, but the necessary state. And if our philos-\\nophy fails to allow it, perhaps we must change our\\nphilosophy!\\n\\nSuch a paradoxical immediacy of otherness—at once a\\ntrue realism (for our “phenomena” would thus acquire the\\nimmediate objectivity they seem to have) and a true ideal-\\nism—would constitute the dilemma-solving insight. Mo-\\ndernity, through the firm logic of its subjective certitude\\nand the derived empiricism of private sense data, must\\nreject it as impossible. It becomes necessary in our philos-\\nophy to pass beyond modernity.\\n\\nii. Political Theory Makes an Effort:\\nPartial Solution\\nLer us note in passing that contemporary political\\n\\ntheory shows signs of recognizing this quandary and of\\nmoving toward a solution.\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 29\\n\\nIt has well outgrown the stage at which the subject’s\\nobedience has to be understood as a contract or counsel of\\nprudence. It listens with less than half an ear to the\\npresent school of “legal realists” disposed to interpret law\\nas a “threat,” as if most of us were at heart transgressors.\\nWithout too heavy an investment in the nonrational im-\\npulses proposed by the various depth psychologies, it\\nrecognizes that rationalistic egoisms are not plausible de-\\nscriptions of human nature. Primitive impulses, such as\\nthe herd instinct, and the natural dispositions of the\\nhuman will to serve, through family, clan, posterity in\\ngeneral, aims outreaching private good, insufficient as they\\nare for a developed theory, at least point the way to a more\\nadequate psychology of political life.\\n\\nWith a realer realism, political theory now perceives\\nthat the will to obey has permanent sources in what men\\nthink and believe about their total environment—in cosmic\\nbearings and allegiances not supplied by the visible com-\\nmunity. With great courage, Professor Robert MacIver\\npoints out that the “web of government” is sustained in\\npart by an element of “myth.” Why myth?\\n\\nMyth seems on the face of it a step into the vague—\\nsomething less tangible or structurally useful than those\\nideal standards—truth, justice, beauty, et cetera—which\\nancient philosophy singled out as universal guides for the\\nhuman will. These guides the Stoic legalists could specify\\nfor legal use and Justinian’s codifiers hand on to the law-\\nmakers of Europe. Modernity, however, has dealt hardly\\nwith these standards; it is bound on its own principle of\\nsubjectivity to reduce all principles (including its own) to\\nthe level of psychological variables. Are they not creatures\\nof the subjective I-think? I look on them with a sentiment\\nof regard; but have they a footing in the nature of things\\n30 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nbeyond my psychological setup? Here myth may inject a\\nword.\\n\\nWhat myth adds is the suggestion—through song and\\nstory, through its appealing store of admirabilia and\\ndetestabilia—that they may have such a footing. The quiet\\nmolding of wills through the pictured decisions and char-\\nacters of gods and heroes is empirically near-universal.\\nReligion goes farther: it adds the responsible assertion\\nthat they do have such a footing—as world view, religion\\nis the affirmation of the anchorage in reality of ideal ends.\\nMyth, as the more tentative position, may well be more\\nagreeable to the scientific temper: it is confessed hypoth-\\nesis, whereas religion is dogma. But it contains the im-\\nportant advance, an escape from psychological debility to\\nthe outer air of speculative metaphysics—the word “spec-\\nulative” here meaning “inquiring”!\\n\\nThis escape is essential, But it must be justified. The\\ndilemma of modern thought has been created by phi-\\nlosophy, and philosophy, not imagination alone, must re-\\nsolve it. How can we keep the treasure of subjective depth,\\nand at the same time retain hold on universal validity in\\nour experience?\\n\\niv. Passing beyond Modernity: Intersubjectivity\\nand Participation\\n\\nIr 1s the present century that has met the persistent\\nphilosophical issue.\\n\\nThe revolt against subjectivism had begun earlier. A\\nsturdily growing social science could not operate with\\nclosed individual selfhoods. The quandary of solipsism had\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 31\\n\\nto be overcome or broken through. There was an inviting\\npath much followed prior to the turn of the century—that\\nof resolutely dissolving the supposedly impenetrable ego\\nin the social milieu, showing how far the development of\\nthe I-think is molded by language and social interaction.\\n‘There was important truth along this path (as followed by\\nMead, Baldwin, and others) ; only, Descartes’ logic was\\nnot thereby met, it was submerged in the advancing wave\\nof psychological sociability. And if this were the whole\\ntruth, the prize of modernity’s deepened subjectivity is\\nsurrendered—the proud and pregnant loneliness of free\\nindividual creativity and right.\\n\\nThe solution was achieved by an opposite path—one\\nwhich in the end made full use of the new social insights,\\nbut which began by following further the logic through\\nwhich the quandary appeared, aided by a more perceptive\\nanalysis of what we call “experience.”\\n\\n“Experience” is modernity’s magic word of charm.\\n“Experience” is the suggested sum, or integral, of all the\\nitems, the da’s, of human empiricism. The word is con-\\nveniently noncommittal as to whose experience is implied\\n—whether my sole-own, or ours—yours-and-mine, or per-\\nhaps mankind’s-in-general. It suggests, without asserting,\\nan actual world-wide consubjectivity (as we have above\\ntermed the genuine “we,” p. 27) such as would exist if\\nthe ego and its fellows shared an identical object. What\\nthe newer analysis has discerned within “experience” —\\nand what Plato and Descartes and Kant had failed to find\\nthere—is an intersubjective Thou-art, inseparable from\\neach subjective I-am, serving to bind their several experi-\\nences together in such wise that the loose suggestion of a\\nshared experience with an identical object is defined and\\n82 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nconfirmed. The idea of a literal consubjectivity toward a\\ncommon world object is realized.\\n\\nFor note: As the term “experience” is noncommittal\\nas to the identity of the subject or subjects who are ex-\\nperiencing, so the term “TI-think” is equally noncommittal\\nas to the experience or experiences it includes. Descartes\\nleft the matter open: he failed to mention the content of\\nthe I-think as essential to its existence, and accordingly\\npassed no judgment as to whether this content need be\\nexclusive in order that the I-think hold its identity. Now\\nthe only condition under which any self can be aware of its\\nown existence is that it is occupied with some content; and\\nclearly the sole possibility that any self should enter the\\nexperience of another is that some content, some bit of\\nexperience, should be not exclusive but had in common,\\nand known to be common. If experience could thus be\\nshared, directly or through some third subject, solipsism is\\nat an end, and yet without the fusion of self into self.\\n\\nWhat we can now verify is that private experiencing, as\\nreceptive, is a certain participation of each I-think in the\\nexperience of an intersubjective Thou-art. Through this\\nparticipation, my experience acquires the substantial “ob-\\njectivity” of being no private dream of my own. And so\\nfar as these participations extend to all, our common\\nobjects enter the single world wnity common intuition has\\nalways assumed them to have.\\n\\nBut further, the presence of this uniting selfhood pro-\\nvides the assurance that the common experience of man-\\nkind has an indwelling purpose, a telos, in which the I-am\\nalso participates. My aims cease to be mere psychological\\ndistillates of private passions; they have “an anchorage in\\nreality.” Therewith a way of hope opens for the individual,\\ngroping for significance.\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 83\\n\\nv. General Course of the Philosophical Argument\\n\\nTo sxrrcu briefly the path by which this result has been\\nreached:\\n\\nSolipsism, we have noted, has never been believed ; but it\\nhas frequently been taken as an inescapable incident of our\\nbeing selves, each with an unsharable center of feeling and\\nperspective reference, whose intimate continuities of ex-\\nperience-and-memory-and-wish are only fragmentarily\\ncommunicable in the coin of common speech. The logic of\\nsolipsism has been taken most seriously by the most strenu-\\nously logical thinkers, as by the early Bertrand Russell\\nfollowing Leibniz, and by the later Edmund Husserl. This\\nwas the necessary course of philosophical honor, if the\\n“egocentric predicament”—to use Ralph Perry’s perfect\\nphrase—were to be logically overcome and not simply\\nbroken through in favor of the claims of common intuition.\\n\\nThe first step in this logical overcoming was the recog-\\nnition that the solipsist position contains a self-refutation.\\nIt is not merely inconsistent with our natural behavior, as\\nwhen solipsists commune with their fellows, or when Mrs.\\nLadd-Franklin, solipsist by logical conviction, writes to\\nBertrand Russell expressing “surprise that there are not\\nmore of us.” It is further inconsistent with its own assump-\\ntions. For the proposition “I am incurably alone” implies\\nthat I know what being-alone is contrasted with: the prop-\\nosition is significant only if I know what it would be to be\\nnot-alone. But if I were constitutionally alone I would be\\nunaware of that fact, having no conception of the oppos-\\ning condition of being. Leibniz must get mentally out of\\nhis monadic window and circulate among the monads in\\norder to know that none of them, including his own, has\\nwindows! In brief, no one can speak or think universally\\nB34 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nof the monads unless monadism is a fallacy. To take\\nDescartes literally is thus, in the end, to break with\\nDescartes.\\n\\nBut shall the break be a simple repudiation, or shall it\\nbe by way of a more incisive logic?\\n\\nFor the most part, philosophy at the turn of the century\\nacted by repudiation, and the substitution of alternative\\ntheories of knowledge. Henri Bergson reinstated “intui-\\ntion” (1903) as a cognitive resource, able to “coincide”\\nwith its objects, including other selves and the semipur-\\nposive élan vital, This cures solipsism in a convincing way,\\nsince Bergson’s intuition is every man’s intuition made\\nsystematic and responsible, and the cure is valid. But since\\nit acts by force majeure, i.e., by simply endowing one\\ncognitive function with the power of self-transcendence\\n(as the older dogmatic realisms did for all cognitive func-\\ntions), the intellectual problem remains unsolved; and\\nBergson, by disqualifying the “intellect” in metaphysics,\\nwaived the effort to solve it.*\\n\\n* The resurgent realisms of this perlod followed in the main the path\\nof repudiation, asserting a natural power of self-transcendence in human\\nknowledge, and rejecting extant attempts to express the “objectivity”\\nof the natural world as a domain of thought or (with Royce) of purpose.\\nRoyce and others in America and Simmel in Berlin felt more definitely\\nresponsible for the underlying problem, how any awareness of a mind-\\nnot-one’s-own is possible. The answers tended, as in the metaphysic of\\nKant, to shift from the rational to the moral: the other mind is a being\\nwe ought to acknowledge, not aspire to experience. Whitehead was later\\nto offer the most radical repudiation of solipsism, by quictly discarding\\n\\ntthe entire causal account of perception (of which subjectivism is an\\nlineseapable corollary), in favor of a theory of “prehensions” involving\\ndirect other-awareness.\\n\\nMeantime Husserl, in Giéttingen, with the utmost logical care and\\nseruple, had opened his campaign against one aspect of subjectivism,\\nPeychologismus, making salient the “intentional” factors of thinking, and\\ninvoking “Wesensschau,” a perceiving of concepts, to guarantee their\\nvalidity. This analysis remained interior to the Cartesian I-think; it was,\\nas he later called it, “egological.” It was not until his Parisian Lectures\\nof 1929 that he explicitly faced the issue of solipsism, and reached a\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 35\\n\\nThe second and affirmative step in the overcoming of\\nsolipsism remained to be taken. It depended on a con-\\nsideration closely following the first step; namely, that\\nsince we do have the conception of aloneness, it must also\\nbe true that we have the conception of not-aloneness; and\\nthat conception we could not get by solitary imagination\\n—the materials of a solitary experience do not provide the\\nright kind of otherness to construct the idea of other-mind.\\n‘The conception of companionship is possible only if there\\nis somewhere the actual experience thereof. Solipsism is\\novercome, and only overcome when I can point out the\\nactual experience which gives me the basis of my concep-\\ntion of companionship. There must be such an experience\\nof other-mind-present, not reducible to an I-think-enjoy-\\ning-a-pantomime-companionship. The problem is to iden-\\ntify this experience beyond possible recapture by my\\nall-embracing subjectivity.\\n\\nThe quest has its difficulties. Minds are not perceivable\\nas are the bodies to which we attribute mentality. Our\\nvoluminous and skillful intercourse with our fellows is\\ndeveloped on the basis of an immensely successful hypoth-\\nesis that such-and-such visible and tangible objects are\\nsigns of mentality-and-purpose: the hypothesis of signs\\nimplies a prior idea of other-mind-expressing-itself-by-\\nsigns. What we are interested in is the origin of that prior\\nidea~—an idea for which there could be no corresponding\\nsensation. It must be present very early, for infants ap-\\npear to use it; and if truly intersubjective, then pervasive,\\nand like all continuous experiences almost evanescent. We\\nmust be prepared to think that it has no determinate\\n\\nposition which he described (with a precise ambiguity) as “monado-\\nlogical intersubjectivity” (Husserliana, I, 121 et passim, 1950). Solution\\nincomplete.\\n36 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nbeginning; that each one is always consciously participat-\\ning in the life of an Other, inseparable from his own sense\\nof being, even on the preconceptual level of bodily aware-\\nness. How can such an experience be traced or identified?\\n\\nWe are helped by recalling, what we have already\\nobserved, that Descartes, in singling out the I-think as the\\nfulcrum of his lever, has left us with an unfinished expres-\\nsion, There is no I-think (period). It is always I-think\\n(something). An empty mind is not even idly contempla-\\ntive: the vacant mind is simply nonexistent. If the premiss\\nis cogito nihil, the inference has to be ergo non swum—an\\ninference which the ego would be in no position to draw!\\n\\nI do not mean to say that Descartes’ omission of the\\nsomething-thought-about was an oversight. Finding that\\nhe could doubt the existence of whatever object, and as\\nhis chef d’oewvre of doubt that of the world itself, he felt\\nfree to concentrate his certitude of existence on the think-\\ning process. Not dismissing stuff-thought-about, he was\\nsimply suspending the attribution of existence to that\\nstuff, precisely as Husserl has done in his epoché. But if it\\nis granted that my empirical existence depends on a con-\\ntinuous I-think-something-empirical (presumably with a\\nrill of sense data at the base of it), I can only be sure I\\nexist if something (else) exists also. In order to be valid\\nthe Cartesian certitude requires to be enlarged: cogito\\naliquid ergo sum, et aliquid est: I think something, there-\\nfore I exist, and something (else) exists. It still remains\\ntrue that my thinking involves my existence; the point is,\\nit involves more.\\n\\nIndeed, the proposition that I can doubt the existence\\nof every object of thought is a fallacy. For to doubt exist-\\nence is to know what it is that I doubt—I must know what\\nI mean by the existence of the object. And I can know this\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 87\\n\\nonly if there is a knowable difference between the existent\\nand the nonexistent object, in which case it would be im-\\npossible to doubt the existence of objects presenting the\\nknown criterion. The doubt is thus either meaningless or\\nself-defeating.\\n\\nWe arrive at the position—not without a suggestion of\\nparadox—that something of the not-self is essential to the\\nexistence of the self. The matter becomes clear when we\\nconsider what we mean by sense data. Data are things\\ngiven; and what is being “given” is in transit from an\\nouter source to a receiver—only in this case what is given\\nis not a detachable commodity, it is an essential factor in\\nthe being of the receiver. That is what “experiencing”\\nliterally is—a process in which the not-self is continuously\\nbecoming self. In the incessant rill of the empirical strand\\nof living, always including sensation, the self is being\\nsustained in being. To that extent we may say it is being\\ncreated.*\\n\\nWe might now take it as a self-evident proposition that\\nwhatever creates a self can only be a self. We should then\\nhave arrived at our goal. Our empirical receptiveness to\\nthe sensed world is something more crucial and inward\\nthan an observing of variegated qualities out-there: it is\\nalso a receiving of my own life from a life-giving entity,\\n\\n4“However vigorous the impetus of advance-weaving on the part of\\nmy ideas (my active expectations of experience just ahead)... my\\nown activity always accepts the irruptive (sense-) material as its own\\nauthority and completion, Toward that outer reality I hold myself as\\ntoward that which sustains me from moment to moment in my present\\nbeing. Is not that outer activity then essentially creative . . . creative\\nof me?” The Meaning of God in Human Experience, 286 f.\\n\\nWe may recall in this connection a speculation of Descartes to the effect\\nthat God does not create once and then leave his world to itself, but that\\nhe re-creates the world from moment to moment.

Appeal to Immediate Experience\\n\\nBur dispensing with further argument, let me now\\nrather seek to evoke in the reader that awareness which\\nmust be the final evidence of our result. For what we are\\nhere asserting is an element in the experience of every\\nperson: it must be verifiable there.\\n\\nWe do not ordinarily consider the world we perceive as\\nan activity upon ourselves. We perceive it as a simple\\nthereness of the sense-presented expanse. And there is\\nno I-think in the picture. We can go all the way with\\nHume, who discovers no “self” among his impressions: by\\nno possibility can the self be a sense object. To catch a\\nglimpse of one’s self requires a shift of vision, a turn which\\nwe call “reflexion.” One can always make this turn, and\\nalways find the I-think on duty; especially when I am in\\ndoubt as to what I see, or am challenged. “I saw an air-\\nplane.” You doubt it? “Z think I saw one”; I retreat to the\\nasylum of certitude.

The theory, useful for relationships,\\nis bankrupt as an account of perception,\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 39\\n\\nfar-off plane—it may be a bird”; I ask your corrobora-\\ntion.\\n\\nThe same turn that brings the I-think into the picture\\nbrings also the sharableness: the simple thereness is al-\\nready common experience, common receptivity toward an\\nintersubjective action. Yet as action it is wholly different\\nfrom any activity I might perceive in the field of there-\\nness: it is silent, unrelenting, with no insistence on change,\\nmore like a firm pressure-of-being from the unnamed,\\nunvocal, nonintrusive Other. I recognize it as the will of\\nanother self, a purposive selfhood, purposing among other\\nthings the being of this I-think. It is the Thou-art, imme-\\ndiately experienced as such.\\n\\nEven so, the Thou-art is not salient. In its aboriginal\\nform, it is a constant vital fact, beneath the level of con-\\ncepts: it may be intrauterine as a vague awareness of\\ndependent being, with an equally vague possibility of\\naddress-of-discomfort to the surrounding universe. But\\nthere is a point at which this locus-of-address becomes dis-\\ntinct and recognizable:\\n\\n“Experiencing,” as a rule, while we receive what is\\ngiven, is also an activity on our own part—an activity of\\nattention, more or less awake and alert. This activity is so\\nfar spontaneous that we do not associate it with a sense of\\neffort. There arises, however, in the course of conscious\\ndevelopment, an issue of free effort in dealing with what is\\ngiven. Sense data by themselves constitute no “world.”\\nThere are two ways of taking them. We may steep our-\\nselves in their immediate quality for the purely aesthetic\\nenjoyment of that quality—the incipient epicure or artist\\nin all human nature. Or we may, with an effort of thought,\\nwork them into patterns of “object” and “event” which\\n40 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmove toward responsible living, in the end to science itself.\\nDescartes in his view of the I-think raises no issue of this\\neffort—his broad expression includes the whole range of\\nsensing, feeling, willing, et cetera, as well as the intentional\\n“thinking” involved in forming a coherent world picture.\\nWhat, I now ask, is your incentive for this effort to think\\na world?\\n\\nIt is—and here I venture like Descartes, but with better\\njustification, to interpret your experience for you—it is\\nsomething like an intimation of your destined way of liv-\\ning.\\nThe world I think, as distinct from the nonworld I sense,\\nis a range of experience sharable with others. If I am to\\nlive as my élan vital spurs me to live, I must live in a field\\nof experience not mine alone. But my first note-of-call is\\nnot from these many unidentified fellows: it is from the\\ninner source of the sense-presented expanse, with which\\nsource I am aware of a certain kinship. My impulse to live\\nby thinking, rather than by sensing alone, is a response to\\na felt purposiveness of the real with which in experience I\\nhave to do. It is akin to that sense of duty, which to Kant\\nwas our most direct approach to being-in-itself. But it is a\\nwider thing. It is the apprehension of a way of life that\\nLife assigns me; it is a sort of compass needle toward self-\\nfulfillment and duty at once, in one urge of will direction.\\nIf there is in it a sense of the right of the universe against\\nme, commonly called “duty,” there is equally a sense of my\\nright as against the universe that has thrust life upon me:\\nif there is any obligation at all, it is reciprocal. And both\\nsenses imply the prior awareness that the source of things\\nis a Thou—a Being fit on the one hand to receive my note\\nof protest where protest is due, and on the other hand to\\npervade my living with a sense of expected performance.\\nPASSAGE BEYOND MODERNITY 41\\n\\nFor Kant, the primary and inescapable reality of duty\\nis the source of our postulate of God. In this order of\\nthings, the actualities of experience are reversed. Unless\\nthere is first a known being to whom duty can be due, there\\ncan be no duty. And there is more than duty, more than\\nreciprocal duty, in the actual situation. There is, as I shall\\nlater emphasize, an element of faith-in-opportunity; a\\nhopeful launching out on the effort to achieve the costly\\nhappiness of becoming what I am destined to become. All\\nthis is wrapped up in the spontancous impulsive summon-\\ning of one’s will-to-think, the simplest and most general\\nresponse to the presence in experience of the universal\\nOther-mind.\\n\\n‘The strength and persistence of that response is seen in\\nthe corporate and historic edifice we call “science,” a build-\\ning surely not made with hands. This building testifies to\\nthe assurance whereby our monadic worlds are known as\\none world; and whereby the lonely experimenter, wherever\\nhe is, knows his discovered truth as unquestionably a truth\\nfor every man.\\n\\nWith this assurance, verified in experience because aris-\\ning there, we have passed beyond modernity into the post-\\nmodern era.\\n\\nvii. Juncture of Philosophy and Religion\\nat a Deeper Level\\n\\nI nave presented this result as the outcome of an ex-\\nperiment, the “unintentional experiment” of modernity. It\\nis at the same time a dialectical result; for any experience\\nof commitment to a thought must be a thought-filled ex-\\nperience. It is through carrying the logic of solipsism to\\nthe end that its cure is found. Modernity has thus held to\\n42 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nits own type of certitude, its science, its humanistic con-\\nfidence in human thinking—in brief to its “I-think”—\\nuntil on its own empirical ground it sees its incomplete\\ntruth.\\n\\nWhat religion may say, and truly say, is that this inter-\\nsubjective reality is nothing other than its own eternal and\\nunswerving doctrine of God, whose meaning in human\\nexperience is now belatedly discerned. T’o which Modern-\\nity might be conceived to reply, “That is true; and reli-\\ngion’s honor also is to hold to its own certitude. But that\\ncertitude has not hitherto been held, nor could it be held, as\\nan answer to the question which I, Modernity, alone have\\nraised. It is I who have descended deepest into the Hell of\\nthe soul’s solitude. And having through the agony of my\\nown loyalty to truth at last been able to say, ‘Behold Thou\\nart there,’ I add for all future time that dimension to the\\nmeaning of religion.”\\n\\nHerewith the question inevitably emerges whether the\\nreconceived religion which thus takes form as an answer to\\nthe dilemma of modernity is to be the Christian religion,\\nor some other of the great religions, or some development\\nbeyond them.\\n\\nBut first, an interlude on how civilizations rise and fall\\n—and how far!\\nSTUDY III\\n\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF\\nHISTORY\\n\\ni. Résumé: Tentative Outlook for State and Church\\n\\nOur concern is with the shape of the civilization to come.\\nAs guiding lines we consider especially the place in that\\ncivilization of the state and the religious community, since\\neach of these undertakes in its own way to reflect and\\nsatisfy the whole of human nature.\\n\\nWe have first examined the state. For if, as intelligent\\nhumanists, we can get on without religion, the state be-\\ncomes our trust. However great our faith in the human\\nindividual, we have never thought him self-sufficient. Man\\nis a creator; but he is a creator who must first be created.\\nIf it were only on the basis of everyday wants, he must live\\nin society ; and while the economic necessity is instructive\\nas to his shaping and being shaped, we are today less than\\never persuaded by the Marx-Engels following—illumi-\\nnating for its time—that the logic of his economic needs\\ncan explain man’s social history or his cultural prowess,\\nstill less outline his destiny. As modern men, we still see\\nwith Aristotle the political community as the specific\\ninstrument of “the good life” in its human amplitude; and\\nmodern man still nearer approaches Aristotle’s persuasion\\n\\n43\\n44 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthat in this respect the state is “nearly if not quite self-\\nsufficient.” We recall that Greece had almost nothing\\ncorresponding to a church. As for economy, we see that it is\\nthe political community that shapes the economy, not the\\neconomy that makes the nation.’ It is the state which holds\\nwithin the grasp of a unified will-to-power both the eco-\\nnomic and the social needs of man.°\\n\\nThis does not mean that we have ever mistaken the state\\nfor the cosmos, or imagined that for practical purposes the\\nstate is equivalent to “the whole.” We simply see in it the\\none representative of the totality of being with which we\\ncan converse: it is for us the responsible, and in general\\nthe responsive, image of the whole of things. We may in a\\nsense pray to it, and sometimes be heard: of what other\\nsymbol of totality can this be said? The state, like all\\nthings human, is finite: and the gap between the finite and\\nthe infinite remains—infinite. If, as some say, and I am\\nwith them, it is with the infinite that we have always to do,\\nthe state must be infinitely short of complete competence.\\nAgreed. But the gap that is logically infinite may be\\npsychologically negligible. If, as seems evident, everything\\ntangible is finite, and the state’s purview reaches to all the\\nrelevant tangibles, trust in the state, slowly perfectible\\nthrough infinite time, seems the path of available wisdom.\\nSecular modernity has, in effect, committed itself to this\\nexperiment. We have followed some of its findings.\\n\\nAt this its strongest point, we have found modernity\\nvulnerable, and with modernity, the state. Its Achilles’\\nheel, if we are right, is not itself a tangible and overt weak-\\nness—say the rationalizing or technicalizing of society, or\\n\\n1 Politics, 1262 b.\\n\\n2 Man and the State, 296,\\n* Tbid., 330.\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 45\\n\\nthe functional character that thus descends on the indi-\\nvidual’s self-definition, or the simple existence of the “mass\\nman” with his diminished and derivative mentality. These\\nare indeed disturbing traits of the life of modern man,\\nproud in his newly won dignity, freedom, and scientific\\npower, and those who, like Ortega y Gasset, dwell on them\\nare on the right scent. But as evils-flowing-from-goods\\nthey are, I believe, symptoms of a malady simpler and\\ndeeper rooted, an inner surrender, the gradual abandon-\\nment of the individual’s native rapport with a genuine—\\nnot representative—total-and-real, an immediate \\'Thou-\\nart, which is at the same time his avenue of rapport with\\nhis fellow men.\\n\\nWith this surrender has come the tacit relinquishment\\nof his certitude of the universality of his private experi-\\nence and therefore of his confidence. For man in the same\\nmoment, and by the same fact, that makes him solidary-at-\\nroot with his tribe and with humanity, is individualized\\nand set beyond crowd pressures. It is his private tryst with\\nthe Absolute, whereby his certitude is at once every man’s\\ncertitude so that he can think and speak for man-in-\\ngeneral, that normally enables him to hold his own in\\npresence of whatever strains arise from social organiza-\\ntion. Losing that rapport, he loses what makes him a state-\\nsustaining being. The state by itself cannot insure its own\\nperpetuity.\\n\\nThis diagnosis, which I have offered as an experimental\\nand also as a dialectical outcome of modernity, exemplifies\\nan ancient paradox, the paradox of power. The secular\\nstate has become not only the greatest of tangible powers,\\nbut in concrete terms, the sole power—the trusted reposi-\\ntory of all the physical forces of the community. And\\nLeviathan at the peak of his all-might is lamed. By what?\\n46 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nBy deficiency in the field of motivation, a lack of control in\\nthe region of “mere feeling.” It is the nonassertive Tao of\\nLao Tze that still bends the strongest to its demand.\\n\\nBut while a diagnosis may and should point to a remedy,\\nit is not itself a prescription. The integrating of human\\nmotives is the business of religion; but religion is not a\\ncommodity that can be prescribed, nor is it a staple. It\\nexists for itself alone, and while always the same, as the\\nbond between the soul of man and the Real, it varies in-\\nternally with its specific tasks. For what that bond requires\\ndepends on the depth and character of the separation\\nbetween the soul and its object due to varying experience\\nand thought. The Real is by definition eternal; but the\\nreligious questioning of modern man is not necessarily met\\nby the expositions of religion for premodern man. That\\nissue lies before us.\\n\\nMeanwhile, if we may tentatively assume that there\\nexists a mode of religion prepared or preparable to mend\\nthe lost rapport between the modern soul and the Absolute,\\nour analysis provides certain indications of the role of its\\ncommunity in any future civilization.\\n\\nBecause religion can never serve as a “means only”—~a\\nmeans for curing the ills of the state—the dependence\\nbetween church and state is not mutual. T\\'he state is de-\\npendent for its vital motivation wpon an independent reli-\\ngious community. It must therefore allow the free exercise\\nof religion so far as religion is honest—i.e., so far as it\\nserves its function of integrating the human will in view\\nof the whole—simply because nothing that is not free and\\nuniversal can be religion,\\n\\nThis duty of the state does not infringe the state’s con-\\nceptual sovereignty, nor is it in general onerous. It leaves\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY at\\n\\nsovereignty intact, because the duty in question is not a\\nlegal duty: it is a duty arising simply from the logic of\\nthe state’s self-preservation.\\n\\nIt is not, in general, onerous, because the civilized state\\ntakes it for granted that its citizens are full-grown men,\\nhaving their own hold on principle; it knows that it can be\\nserved only by individuals who are first of all servants of\\ntruth and honor. To this extent, the modern state is en-\\ntirely at home with the principle that the primary loyalty\\nof its subjects is and ought to be beyond itself. At the same\\ntime, the possibility of clash between state and church is\\nwritten into the situation.\\n\\nFor example, the religious community is by definition\\nuniversal in extent as well as in norms of will: it speaks not\\nprimarily to the man-within-the-nation but to the man-\\nwithin-the-world. It spins the web of a potential world\\nsociety. Reaching across all boundaries it fosters a moral\\nunity among men without which international order lacks\\na necessary precondition—that of psychological frater-\\nnity. For peace and order must be built on mutuality of\\nfeeling before they can be built on laws and powers. This\\npreliminary work toward world community can never be of\\nindifference to the state. On the whole it tends to be in\\naccord with national purposes; but it can bring a radical\\ncriticism to bear on national egoism, the more effective as\\nits own fellowship becomes actually as well as intentionally\\nworld-wide.\\n\\nAnd the state has no choice but to accept this possibility\\nof clash, whether in foreign policy or in domestic affairs,\\na possibility which—in spite of all efforts to make a firm\\nline between the standards of politics and morals—effec-\\ntively limits its freedom of action to courses that do not\\nmassively violate the consciences of its people. The state\\n48 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhas no choice, because the subjects for their part—unable\\nto escape their knowledge of the state’s finitude—have\\nthemselves no choice but to find their primary loyalties in\\nwhatever glint they may discover through inward clues of\\nan absolute good.\\n\\nTt can never be the state’s duty-——as premodernity some-\\ntimes assumed possible—to deduce positive law and policy\\nfrom the premisses of religion and ethics, for which these\\npremisses are incompetent, as Aquinas clearly saw. But it\\nwill always be the duty of the state, unless by persuasion it\\ncan transvalue the values of its people, to create policies\\nthat do not contradict these premisses. This is a principle\\nof politics as old as Confucius, in which Machiavelli\\nshrewdly concurs, a principle which will remain valid as\\nlong as the state must live in the freely accorded respect\\nand consent of its members.\\n\\nBut if the state has a duty, so has the church. For the\\ncontinuing historical community of religion, undertaking\\nto offer an unshakable world affirmation in which primary\\nloyalties may be anchored, must probe the depth of the\\nsoul’s lostness in the given era of man’s thought, even while\\ndistraction and despair may be far off. Religion has fre-\\nquently to disturb the undisturbed, to create anew a sense\\nof that moral aloneness-with-the-Absolute which is the sole\\nsecurity against the anaesthesia of crowd insouciance. For\\nthe individual, circumstance and the current temper may\\nbenumb his “cosmic anxiety”; yet that anxiety remains a\\nmeasure of his realism, not of his folly, it must be the\\ngroundwork of all his building. Religion must always spur\\nthe soul not to evade experience nor new-opening truth\\nbut to descend into the caverns, psychological and other,\\nthat science or public crisis may open for exploration.\\nReligion must descend with the soul, while keeping intact\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 49\\n\\nthe thread of recovery of a true universality. “Saving the\\nsoul” in this sense must be the ever-renewed and ever-\\nchanging duty of religion.\\n\\nIt becomes here especially apparent that in this duty\\nthe state has no competence; and yet depends for its vital-\\nity on that well-grounded firmness of character which it\\ncannot of itself supply. With this understanding, the rela-\\ntion of church and state cannot be either now or in the\\nfuture one of rivalry, nor of duplication in the task of\\ninterpreting human nature. It is a natural symbiosis, on\\nthe ground of the priority and autonomy of the religious\\nconsciousness.\\n\\nui. Obliteration of Historic Rhythm: the Unlosable\\n\\nBur what can we discern of the shape of the civilization\\nthat is to succeed what we call modernity? What guidance\\ncan history give us as to the passage toward recovery? Is\\nhumanity perhaps following a rhythm, now passing from\\nits upward to its downward phase, so that we must antici-\\npate a period of confusion, if not of Untergang?\\n\\nHistory has indeed its repetitions of rhythmic tracery,\\nlending force to the judgment that civilizations, too, are\\nmortal. But as a whole, history never repeats; partly be-\\ncause civilizations have seldom perished—perhaps never\\nin toto. Commonly in their phase of ebb they have injected\\nsomething of their essence into a rising movement else-\\nwhere, ruder and fuller of will-to-live—within chaos, con-\\ntinuity. By whatever it thus inherits, that rising movement\\nstarts from an altered level, excluding the concept of\\nrecurrence, Is this inherited element ephemeral and acci-\\ndental, or may some of it keep its place?\\n\\nThere is in history a certain tough cumulativeness at\\n50 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntwo levels—levels at which mankind cannot forget—the\\nlevel of technic and the level of insight. At these levels\\nthere is set into human nature a mental ratchet which pre-\\nvents total slipping back, a selective holding function\\nwhich can easily escape notice amid apparently unlimited\\nchange. Arts have been lost, but not all arts—the art of\\nfire-making, the taming of animals, the conquest of the\\nsea, the art of printing. . . . Sciences have been lost,\\neven astronomies and geometries, but not the multiplica-\\ntion table, nor once devised in India the arithmetical zero,\\nnor once mastered in Greece the science of proof... .\\nPoetry is born profuse as the flowers of the field, and van-\\nishes as they do; and there is poetry the race cannot for-\\nget. . . . Religions likewise. In religion, the unforget-\\ntable may be more evident than the rationally final, and\\nperhaps ought to be.\\n\\nI point out simply that there are odd durabilities that\\ncut through the vast rhythm of rising and falling civiliza-\\ntions, checking each fall at a higher point, and that may in\\ndue time put an end to the ending. History, for good rea-\\nsons, finds it hard to identify the cumulative characters.\\nYet unless they are recognized the total structure of his-\\ntory threatens to be that of a record—on the one hand of\\nperpetual passing, das Einmalige, or on the other, of the\\nrecurrent and sterile, losing sight of its most significant\\ningredient, the wnlosable.\\n\\nIf through the role of the unlosable—without appeal to\\nany “law of progress”—we can eliminate to some extent\\nthe rule of rhythm, and so of periodic downfall in the\\nbroad swing of human affairs, as well as of the “eternal\\nrecurrence,” might we not with the same stroke eliminate\\nthe element of plurality in our picture of civilization? In\\nmy judgment, this is now taking place.\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 51\\n\\niii. Elimination of Plurality of Civilizations\\n\\nTopay, we seem to stand on the threshhold of a new\\nthing, civilization in the singular. We still have civiliza-\\ntions: the distinction between The East and The West\\nstill has validity. And what Toynbee calls the aggression\\nof the West upon the East has had an indubitable basis in\\nfact. But whether it has been the whole fact, I doubt; and\\ncertainly, it has long ceased to be the main part of the fact.\\nMuch of what was once transmitted from West to East by\\nthe methods of imperialism has become self-propagating\\n—first imposed, then sought, then demanded as of right. A\\nsiphon flow has usually to be forced to begin with. No one\\nwho has seen a western technical school in the Orient, or an\\nagricultural station, or a hospital, can entertain the pic-\\nture of “aggression” as the dominant fact in these fields,\\nthough aggression has frequently been the frame in which\\nthese transactions have occurred.\\n\\nIn any case, our present period is one of general and\\nreciprocal osmosis of thought, technique, art, and law.\\nThe assimilation proceeds from both sides; though the\\nWest is only beginning to realize its potential property in\\nthe unlosables of the East. These processes can neither be\\nstopped nor undone; the lines that have “gone forth into\\nall the world” cannot return to their origin. The making\\nof a single civilization is contained in the two concepts, the\\nuniversal and the unlosable, plus the simple existence of\\nthe arts of unlimited human communication.\\n\\nHence we may say that for the first time our entire\\nworld space is permeated with ideas which, as Locke said\\nabout truth and the keeping of faith, “belong to man as\\nman and not as a member of society.” Here and there in the\\nOrient there is still revulsion from clinging localisms of\\n52 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nwestern thought and practice, but none toward what we\\nmay call the Clean Universals, the sciences, the mathe-\\nmatics, the technics—these it claims not as borrowings\\nfrom the West, but as its own. In giving birth to the uni-\\nversal, the West has begotten something that can never\\nagain be private property.\\n\\nFor the first time, too, among these ideas are certain\\ndiscoveries of the inner dynamics of material particles\\nwhich deliver into our hands the power to destroy mas-\\nsively whatever man has built—including conceivably,\\nthough not probably, the recondite trails leading to those\\nvery discoveries. The era of “the civilizations” being past,\\nwhat we now enter is either the era of civilization or the\\nera of universal desolation. I shall write as though only\\nthe former alternative were before us; but I shall be writ-\\ning of the conditions under which alone that alternative\\ncan he realized.\\n\\niv. Extent of World-community: Danger of Unbalance\\n\\nWuar is the extent, at present, of this common prop-\\nerty?\\n\\nAs I have suggested, not all parts of a civilization\\nspread with equal pace. Custom, happily, remains local;\\ntogether with folklore and folk arts, and therewith the\\nVolksgeist itself, in which Savigny rightly saw the genius\\nof positive law. These all have universal ingredients, but\\nalso ingredients incurably local; they are not “clean uni-\\nversals.” It is the abstract universal that most swiftly\\nmakes its way, the logic and mathematic, the commercial\\nhabits which in the nature of the case have to cross bound-\\naries, so that commercial and maritime law are the earliest\\ningredients of a working jus gentiwm. Among technical\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 538\\n\\ndevices, arts of agriculture spread more slowly than arts\\nof metallurgy and mining. Political forms, having to link\\ntogether past, present, and future of a persistent national\\ngroup, cannot spread as easily as a turn of industrial\\nartifice,\\n\\nNevertheless, there are no important political or legal\\nideas that are not today shelled out from their local wrap-\\npings and everywhere discussed as universal. Libraries of\\nBuddhist monasteries, and even of the department stores\\nof Tokyo prior to the war, commonly contained political\\nclassics in European languages, not omitting the works of\\nMarx and Engels. The budding Civil Code of prewar\\nChina, as the codes of Japan and Siam at that time rela-°\\ntively new, was fully cognizant of earlier European and\\nAmerican codes, The Chinese code was especially alive to\\nthe universal aspect of a workable civil law; the preface\\nto the first volume, General Principles (in English trans-\\nlation, Shanghai, 1980), refers to the elements of “jurid-\\nical science which are now becoming world-wide,” while\\nindicating that the principles of the law of real property\\nand of the family must retain Chinese localisms.\\n\\nPartly because of the more rapid spread of the abstract\\nuniversal, and partly because of the instinct of modernity\\nfor separation of distinguishable functions, the modern\\nstate everywhere tends to be the secular state, in Asia as\\nwell as in the West. And so far as this is the case, the new\\nstates of Asia inherit the problems which tend to enfeeble\\nthe secular state—as I pointed out earlier.\\n\\nWith this illustration in mind, I hazard the generaliza-\\ntion that it is precisely because of the superior speed and\\npenetrating power of the abstract universals that the com-\\ning civilization is threatened by an unbalance which may\\nimperil its advent.\\n54 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThe claim of the East upon the universals of the West is\\ninvulnerable. It is supported by contributions from the\\nOrient to fields of theory formerly considered the peculiar\\nprovinces of western minds. Fields which are essentially\\nabstract, as mathematics and logic, raise no question of\\nbalance. Fields in which the universal is extracted from\\nits setting, as in law or cosmology, may raise such ques-\\ntion. Let me illustrate:\\n\\nThe theory of “rights” as a basis of law is one of the\\nabstractions whose potential menace to the societies of its\\norigin we have already noticed. It has nevertheless a uni-\\nversal trait which the nineteenth century has been unable,\\nwith the united denunciation of its leading schools of\\njurisprudence, wholly to repress. The new nation-states of\\nour era, eastern as well as western, totalitarian as well as\\nliberal, have been unable to escape at least lip service to\\nthe rights of the natural man. The elaborate Declaration\\nmade by United Nations was not addressed to democracies\\nalone; and the Soviet Constitution of 1936 has a place for\\nthe idea.’ It has been the pride of the modern state of the\\nWest that it can concede to its individual members the\\nmaximum of liberty and right without losing its coherence\\n(a point which drew the admiring comment of Hegel, Phil.\\ndes Rechts, 75 n., presumably with England in mind).\\nBut just on this account, the maxim in question con-\\n\\n* When the subcommission engaged in formulating this Declaration\\ncame to consider the “right to work,” the Soviet delegate favored an un-\\nrestricted assertion of that right, whereas Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, in the\\nchair of the subcommittee, demurred as representing the American view\\nthat economic conditions may not always allow everyone to be employed.\\nThe Soviet delegate urged that the Declaration must present not the\\nactual but the right! The Soviet view prevailed, Today (1955) in the\\n\\nU.S.A. it is labor—i.e., organized labor—that contests the universality of\\nthe “right to work.”\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 55\\n\\nfesses having given the highest possible gage to the uncon-\\ntrollable factor of individual morale. And the contempo-\\nrary western individual is no longer the custom-and-con-\\nscience-borne person of John Locke, nor yet of Blackstone\\nor Jefferson. He presents, as we have noted, a far wider\\npolitical incaleulability. And if this is true in lands still\\naware of traditional premodern intangibles of social con-\\ntrol, what of lands whose intangibles are far different?\\n\\nAnd in both hemispheres today, this incalculability is\\nincreased by the swift persuasive force of an abstract uni-\\nversal in the field of cosmology, on which I have barely\\ntouched.\\n\\nv. Specter of the Purposeless Universe: Unique\\nExigency of Western Civilization becoming Universal\\n\\nIr setones to the empirical conscience of modern\\nscience to relieve nature, not alone of all purpose in the\\nshape of “final causes,” but as well of all quality and value.\\nIf “nature” is synonymous with the cosmos, we men inhabit\\na universe purposeless and meaningless, a realm of fact\\nand event ideally mathematical in process, ideally empty\\nof choice, If this is indeed “the Real” with which we have\\nto do, our human purposes find there no objective support.\\nBut Descartes, who on one side of his dualism has given us\\nthis purpose-purged world picture, is the same as he who\\non the other side has given us the sole certitude of the sub-\\njective I-think. May we then take refuge in our subjective\\nbeing, claiming not only the “secondary qualities,” but the\\nentire realm of value as our own? Since values have no\\nother source, they are “our kingdom”; they impose no\\nobligation—we are free to make them as we will. Indeed,\\n56 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsince there is nothing in the nature of things to steady our\\naim, we are foredoomed to this freedom; and if, as M.\\nSartre sees it, our value-setting decision tends—in\\nstrangely Kantian fashion—to universalize its maxim, it\\ncan be attended with the unique distress (Sartre’s an-\\ngoisse) of unguided responsibility.\\n\\nBut this same empirical conscience that provides the\\npurposeless universe allows us no rest in value-setting sub-\\njectivity. For eventually it turns its searching light upon\\nman himself as an object within nature: it creates a science\\nof man, a psychology, a sociology, an anthropology. And\\nsince the human phenomenon cannot disavow the character\\nof the whole, it, together with its value-setting activities,\\nmust share the resulting desiccation: value-setting is itself\\na product of valueless necessity.\\n\\nOur modern self-awareness is thus confronted with two\\nopposing versions of its own nature, each of which claims\\na certain necessity, while their co-existence presents an\\napparently insoluble enigma. Spinoza’s effort to keep them\\nboth, while avoiding collision by the device of parallel\\ntime orders, fails to satisfy the claim of each to include all\\nthat is valid in the other. And neither of the two gives any\\nbasis for the notion of a right common to all men.\\n\\nWe cannot abandon our empirical conscience, and its\\nconsequences, The methods of a value-free science are\\ngenuine universals, however abstract. And this theory of\\nhuman rights, renascent in the present century, becoming\\npart of a world-wide political pattern, without the con-\\nceptions of human nature that once made democracy in-\\nwardly strong, can only contribute to its disintegration,\\nand tend to dissolve the coming civilization even while we\\nbuild it.\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 57\\n\\nBut we must look again at this scientific world picture\\nwhich is at the heart of at least part of the political embar-\\nrassment of our time, and which, like our individualism,\\ncannot be simply rejected. For this world picture has also\\nbecome an integral part of the entire contemporary civi-\\nlization. The present moment is indeed one of widespread\\nrevolt against what Fechner called the “night view” of\\nnature—that purposeless and qualityless cause-tight uni-\\nverse which a perfected science, including the sciences of\\nman, would insist upon. His classic statement deserves re-\\nreading, for its prophecy is fulfilled in our day. Its open-\\ning represents an experience of perhaps 1840, when he was\\nrecovering from an eye malady which had compelled him\\nto give up his university post. I translate some of the\\nopening paragraphs:\\n\\nOne morning I sat on a bench in the Leipzig Rosenthal in\\nthe neighborhood of the little Swiss chalet, and looked through\\nan opening among the bushes over the wide and lovely meadow\\nthere spread out, in order to refresh my ailing eyes on its\\nexpanse of green. The sun was bright and warm . . . There\\nwere flowers . . . butterflies . . . birds . . .; and notes from\\na morning concert reached my ear. But for one accustomed to\\nthinking, gradvally upon this enjoyment of the senses a play\\nof thought began to spin itself out. . . .\\n\\nStrange illusion, said I to myself. In reality is everything\\nbefore me and around me Night and Silence; the sun that\\nseems to me so blazing-bright that I refrain from turning my\\neyes to it, is in truth only a dark ball seeking its way in perfect\\ngloom. The flowers, butterflies, deceive with their colors, the\\nviolins and flutes with their tones. In this universal darkness,\\ndesolation, silence engulfing heaven and earth, there are scat-\\ntered beings, as it were (conscious) points, inwardly illumined,\\ncolored, sounding; they emerge from the night and sink back\\ninto it, without leaving anything behind of light and sound.\\n58 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\n. . . So today, and so from the beginning, and so will it be\\nforever... .\\n\\nHow could I come on such absurd thoughts? . . . They are\\nthe thoughts of the entire thinking world around me. However\\nelse they differ, in this, philosophers and physicists, Darwin-\\njans and Anti-Darwinians, orthodox and rationalists, reach\\neach other the hand. This is not a building stone, it is the\\nfoundation stone of the contemporary world view.\\n\\nThis is the night view! And, as Fechner continues, “if the\\nworld had ever presented to itself the complete improbability,\\nthe entire weakness of the ground of this view as they came to\\nme in that hour, it could never have become a world view.”\\n\\nAnd with this illumination—for it was such—Fechner finds\\ncomplete confidence that as day succeeds night, so the day view\\nwill eventually succeed the night view.®\\n\\nCertainly the purposeless universe is the negation in ad-\\nvance of all religion in the sense of a cosmic call to right\\nliving, or a rootage in the Real of man’s subjective valua-\\ntions.\\n\\nNevertheless, that night view is itself an achievement of\\nthe first magnitude. It is a conception made possible by the\\nmathematical genius of modernity, and by the empirical\\nhonor of a host of scientific observers. The building of that\\ncorporate body of truth called science is a monumental\\naccomplishment of thought disciplined by a relentless\\nmoral ideal. A godless world picture? Yes; unless, as\\nGandhi seemed to think, Truth is itself a god; for truth as\\nan abiding and growing totality is certainly not a material\\nstructure. As a product of honor-governed thought the\\nedifice of science can never be abandoned, even though the\\n\\n* Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-87), professor of physics in Leipzig,\\nand the chief initiator of experimental and metrical psychology, was a\\nthinker whose genius broke through the crust of then prevalent con-\\nceptions of nature founded on a Cartesian-Newtonian physics. In 1879\\nhe published a small book called The Day View over against the Night\\nViow (Die Tagesansicht gegenueber der Nachtansicht) here quoted,\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 59\\n\\nworld it displays, devoid of inherent purpose, is inanimate,\\nand in this sense a dead world.\\n\\nBoth in its value-purged structure and in its extent, it\\nis a world in which man is lost. Hegel remarks of the\\nRoman world that there for the first time the soul of man\\ncould be thoroughly lost. In our present immeasurably\\nvaster world room of uncountable galaxies and unsayable\\ntime ranges—all indifferent to human fate—the lostness\\nof the human soul attains a depth incomparably greater.\\n\\nAnd note that this is an exigency no prior civilization\\nhas faced. Neither India nor Egypt nor China nor\\nGreece had any conception of the dead world of astro-\\nphysics implied in the clear vision of Descartes. Karma\\nhas indeed an inexorable legality ; but it is a legality sensi-\\ntive to moral qualities, hence not possibly inanimate. In\\nnone of these earlier civilizations had the physical and the\\nmental been sundered, still less the sense qualities of nature\\nfrom the equationable qualities. For instance, a Chinese\\nphilosopher mentioned to me as a point of superiority the\\nfact that China “had no Descartes.” Prior to our seyen-\\nteenth century there had never been anywhere a “bifurca-\\ntion of nature” such as Whitehead has well named and\\ndenounced, together with Goethe and Fechner. And this\\nbifurcation is without doubt an unnatural malady. But\\nunless this malady is experienced, the actual implications\\nof scientific method have not been fully encountered. It is\\nnecessary to the soul’s maturity that the thought of man\\nshould descend into this pit of the meaningless universe.\\nIf he is to be saved from that pit, his metaphysical insight,\\nhis religion, must descend with him.\\n\\nAnd in point of fact, this his religion has already by\\nanticipation done.\\n60 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nvi. Religious Parentage of Night View:\\nPurpose of the Purposeless\\n\\nFor if we rightly read the story of the genesis of modern\\nscience, and answer the question why its relentless logic\\nappeared only in Europe, we shall see that it is the religion\\nof Europe which begot the empirical conscience, and thus\\nindirectly all its fruits. It is not an accident that Bacon\\nin formulating the principle of empirical observation fell\\ninto a form of words recalling the fundamental paradox\\nof Christian morals, “He that loseth his life for my sake\\nshall find it.” Bacon’s words are, “We cannot command\\nnature except by obeying her”—clearly the mental phase\\nof that same paradox. It is the willful curbing of self-will\\nwhich had been the discipline of Christian morals for a\\nmillennium and a half.® It was the purposeful exclusion of\\npurpose from the field of theoretical physies that swung\\nthe door open to a universal science and technology.\\n\\nOnce we have traced this concept of the meaningless uni-\\nverse to its moral origins, we can begin to interpret its\\napparent threat, The original moral purpose is a purpose\\nto “objectify.” But it cannot objectify itself—it may per\\ncontra even forget itself ; yet it cannot expunge itself from\\nthe world picture. The cause-tight character of that uni-\\nverse is a property, not of the whole but solely of what can\\nbe objectified and set into calculable group relations: the\\nnight view, then, valid for its own data, is an abstraction:\\nit omits quality—yet quality is part of the fact; conscious-\\nness—yet consciousness is the condition of any value or\\n“importance” whatever; volition—the response to mean-\\ning and truth—yet volition is there!\\n\\n°I have commented on this parental relationship in What Man Can\\nBake of Man, 26 f.\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 61\\n\\nThe night view, I say, is an abstraction; but it is a nec-\\nessary abstraction. Necessary not alone for the commu-\\nnity of scientific labor, but also because it is only the\\nnonpurposive that purpose can be wholly free to utilize.\\nIt is only an inanimate world segment that can be exploited\\nfor human ends without consideration or compunction. If\\nall actual being were conscious and purposive, plowing a\\nfield would be inflicting microscopic tragedies on an im-\\nmense scale! Hence those who like Fechner and White-\\nhead seek to remedy the appalling vacuousness of nature’s\\nintricate fabric by a universal reanimation are, I fear,\\nsurrendering a genuine and world-changing human ad-\\nvance.\\n\\nWhen it is once seen that the purpose of science cannot\\nextrude purpose and value from an empirical account of\\nthe real, the essential step is taken; and the succeeding\\nsteps must preserve an equally rigorous economy of hy-\\npothesis. The purpose which has revealed the purposeless\\nprocess within nature has for its goal, what? The goal of\\nthe explorer, who must climb Annapurna “because it is\\nthere”? Yes. The mapping of our finite situation within\\nthe endless wonder of fact? Yes. A fading hope of practical\\nadjustments of human living to infinite contingency? Per-\\nhaps. But at least this: a recovery of proportion, of fear-\\nlessness toward the limitless inanimate, through some\\nglimpse of the ulterior purpose of the simple existence of\\nany island of purpose whatever. The progress of physical\\nscience has its own intrinsic joy of mastery—it needs no\\nulterior aim; but with the mastery implied in its powerful\\n(and beautiful) equations, there is joined the anticipation\\nof a further mastery of “understanding.” And it is in this\\nsense that “to master nature” we first yield to her our un-\\nreserved empirical “obedience.”\\n62 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nFor this reason, I can only with qualification follow\\nToynbee in his judgment that the modern period has re-\\njected the guidance of religion in accepting the guidance\\nof man-made science. Unless I am mistaken, the character-\\nistic development of science in modern Europe is not only\\na corollary of the religion of Europe but in a significant\\nsense part of that religion. Scientific empiricism is simply\\nthe constant and unreserved will to truth in yielding one’s\\npreconceptions and wishes to the evidence of fact and of\\nthe universal lawfulness embodied in event.\\n\\nThe vast defection of modernity is not that it has been\\nscientific but that its science has been at critical points\\nuntruthful and therefore unscientific. Through excess of\\nzeal and through forgetting the auspices of its own search\\nfor truth it has made or implied metaphysical assertions\\nto which it has no right, such as that mathematical nature\\nis the whole of reality, and that what empirical science\\ncan show of man is the whole of human nature. A scrupu-\\nlous empiricism of the positivist type would refrain from\\nany such implication. A wider empiricism shows both of\\nthese judgments false.\\n\\nA truthful science will admit that in the strict sense of\\nthe term there is no science of man; there is science only of\\nthe manikin, the robot. Man embodies the duality of the\\nworld, the events which are his life flow both from reasons\\n(including ends) and from causes; but they flow from\\ncauses only by the consent of his reasons. If he fails to eat\\nhe will die; but his instinctive eating is none the less an act\\nof rational will. The life process of man is end-seeking, in-\\nvolving an organism of causes; it is definitely not one of\\ncauses excluding ends. And the end-seeking is a function\\nof his interpretation of reality. In a living universe it may\\nbecome a phase of love; and that love a participation in a\\nTHE STRUCTURE OF HISTORY 63\\n\\npurpose which is the final cause of the whole. On the valid-\\nity of this interpretation, a truthful science passes no\\njudgment.\\n\\nBut the untruthful science has permeated our incipient\\nworld civilization, and is especially deadly where the course\\nof science has entered new ground. The vices of the West\\nbecome the poison of the East, which has no acquired im-\\nmunity. In the transmissions of culture, a new civilization\\nfrequently tends to borrow the perversities of the old; and\\nin this present matter, the englobement of all world process\\nand of human nature in the nexus of physical law, with the\\nresulting secularization of all life, has a peculiar plausibil-\\nity and sanction. The character of the ensuing stage of\\nhistory will depend much on whether with this perversity\\nthere can go also the specific remedy already potentially\\npresent in the West.\\n\\nvii. Can the Religious Parent Meet the Emergency?\\n\\nTue immediate practical suggestion would appear to be\\nthat with the science should go the religion from which its\\nmethod sprang, both in the West and in the East. This\\nsuggestion is significant, but only on two conditions: One,\\nthat Christianity in the West should recover its vitality,\\nand reconceive its message, to the extent of meeting in its\\nown house the malaise of its own offspring. Two, that\\nChristianity can show itself universal and not “western,”\\nand therefore as belonging—with as good a claim as that\\nof science—to all men, not as something borrowed or im-\\nported or imposed from outside, but as their own birth-\\nright.\\n\\nThese are questions to be pursued further.\\nSTUDY IV*\\n\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS\\nCHARACTER AND\\nFUTURE ROLE\\n\\ni. Why Christianity? Its Special Responsibility\\n\\nWe are dealing with long-range alterations of civiliza-\\ntion, in which, we may now assume, religion is somehow\\ninvolved. In spite of the fact that all such long-range\\nalterations take place without our leave and beyond all our\\nplanning, we can now recognize an incipient world civiliza-\\ntion as being ushered in by certain interior necessities of\\nthe historical process—always by the leave of possible\\ncatastrophe from which we perforce abstract. The in-\\nherently universal elements of human culture have begun\\nto be actually universal by spontaneous appropriation.\\nThe dimly unitary world situation thus created inherits\\nfrom the earlier East and West unlosable elements, which,\\nas they accumulate, tend to preserve the area won for com-\\nmon understanding.\\n\\nAmong these common properties are the specific ad-\\nvances which we in the West ascribe to “the modern era.”\\nWith them is inherited also a liability to certain maladies\\ndefinitely apparent in the West. The character of the for-\\n\\n* Portions of Study IV appeared in The Hibbert Journal, July, 1956,\\n\\n64\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 65\\n\\nward movement everywhere will depend on what is done,\\nand first of all on what is thought, about these maladies.\\nMay we escape them by returning to the status quo ante?\\nThe postulate which launches the inquiry of the present\\nStudy is that, even if we would, we cannot escape these\\nills by rejecting these advances, as we are sometimes plaus~\\nibly advised to do.\\n\\nWhat these advances are, and what these perils, I need\\nnot here recapitulate. Yet—as with experience I have\\ncome to fear repetition far less than obscurity—allow me\\nin the briefest terms to restate the main elements of our\\nproblem:\\n\\nThe advances are, first, the advance into a new degree of\\nself-consciousness or subjectivity, which tends to ripen into\\nrelativism and psychologism. And second, the comple-\\nmentary advance into a new degree of objectivity, con-\\nveyed by the scientific method itself, which tends to ripen\\ninto the night view of Fechner and the stupendous vision\\nof the purposeless universe. These gains are borne on the\\nmost swiftly convincing aspects of the modern outlook,\\nthose abstract universals which are inherently every man’s\\nproperty. Our science and technology, for example, require\\nno foreign mission to promote them and call for no “thank\\nyou”: they enter at once and by right into the fabric of\\nwhatever world segment catches their vision, and retaining\\ntheir own identity everywhere, constitute immediately am\\nelement of world unity.\\n\\nWhatever infirmities these ripenings may breed have\\ntheir sources therefore in the genius of modernity itself.\\nThe factors of creative thought which have begotten the\\nadvances including presumably western religion, become\\nco-responsible for the infirmities. And if the West on ac-\\n66 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ncount of the tradition of Christianity has a partial prophy-\\nlaxis against these ills, its natwre deserves an inquiry. I say\\nprophylaxis rather than immunity; for it is precisely in\\nthe western world that the ills have developed in their\\nmost acute form. Christianity has neither prevented their\\nappearance nor cured them. Christianity, as it stands\\ntoday, has still a problem of coexistence with these ad-\\nvances and their results. And further, it does not transmit\\nitself with the same obvious universal right. It does indeed\\nclaim, as must every valid religion, inherent universality ;\\nand it seeks actual universality, chiefly from western\\ncenters. But it moves with far greater resistance than the\\nswift-spreading abstractions of modernity, to which a\\nsecular world view appears most germane; their advance,\\nso far from aiding the progress of Christianity, may ap-\\npear as hostile to its very existence.\\n\\nEspecially the advance into objectivity, with its neces-\\nsary elimination of the purposive factor from the theory\\nof the physical cosmos, presents itself as taking issue not\\nwith Christianity in particular, but with religion in gen-\\neral. It opposes any view that declines to make “Nature”\\na synonym for all there is. The enemy is supernature in\\nany form.\\n\\nYet Christianity is peculiarly involved. For it is not pure\\naccident that the Europe which alone became saturated\\nwith Christianity is the same Europe which alone became\\nthe breeding place of modernity—including “modern sci-\\nence.” There is a parental relation between them becoming\\nslowly evident to historians, some phases of which we have\\nnoticed.\\n\\nThe “I-think, I-exist” of Descartes had an obvious\\npaternity in St. Augustine. But so also, the first principles\\nof the empirical attitude which has become the mark of\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 67\\n\\nthe true scientist, and which forbids the intrusion of his\\npersonal wishes or predilections into the minutely respon-\\nsible work of observation and experiment. There we have\\na definite moral background in two phases of the Christian\\ntradition. First, as we have already noted (p. 60), in the\\nprecept of losing one’s life in order to save it, as the proto-\\ntype of Bacon’s dictum that in order to master nature we\\nmust first obey her, a principle which involved the repudia-\\ntion of the appeal to “final causes” as a reading of human\\nmotivation into natural event. Second, in the derivation of\\nKepler’s later view of the true inwardness of physical\\nprocesses; his verae causae, the genuine causes, as distinct\\nfrom the fanciful or speculative causes which allowed the\\nplanetary motions, for example, to be guided by attendant\\nspirits—these verae causae were homogeneous with the\\neffects, or as a later mathematical concept would express\\nit, the events which constitute nature are a closed group.\\nThis austerity of mathematical principle, he considered,\\nwas alone compatible with that world of perfect law which\\nis God’s thought, and whose beauty is at the same time its\\nfreedom from incongruous admixture. On this ground, he\\nhimself dismissed his planetary spirits as superfluous and\\ninharmonious, and thus handed on to Galileo, Descartes,\\nand Huygens the concept of an autonomous nature,\\ncleared for the unhindered sweep of the equations of a new\\nmathematical calculus.\\n\\nBecause of this parenthood, Christianity is committed\\nas is no other religion to seek a place in its world view for\\nwhat seems its contradiction, the lean and mind-swept sys-\\ntem of nature that appears to follow from these premisses.\\nNature will be conceived, not with Spinoza as another\\nname for God, but as self-operating without God’s intru-\\nsion (natura non sive Deus sed sine Deo).\\n68 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nAnd so long as Christianity coexists with this autono-\\nmous, emancipated, secularized science of nature, moder-\\nnity, uneasily entertaining both, though not in wholly\\nidentical groups, cannot be a single state of mind. It has\\nenjoyed and enjoys a divided consciousness. If Christian-\\nity were able, on its own ground, to overcome this tension,\\nthrough providing a world view of equal integrity and\\ninclusive scope, it would be prepared to relieve various\\nmaladies of the present confused civilization not only in\\nwestern lands, but also in the expanding world scope beset\\nby the same quandaries.\\n\\nWhether it can do so, as a religious interpretation of the\\nhuman lot, factually responsible and inherently universal,\\nis the theme of our present study.\\n\\nii, The Tension as Reflected in Modern Philosophy\\n\\nWuere neither of two opposing views is able to cancel\\nthe other over a considerable period of time—and where\\nin spite of appearances neither is quite willing to do so\\nbecause of a submerged sense of the existing family bond—\\nthe tension between them is likely to be the area of our\\nbest opportunity for deepening our understanding of\\nboth, Thus the long tension between Christianity and the\\ninsights of modernity promises—in view of our postulate—\\nnew and revealing light from some of the most familiar\\npassages of history.\\n\\nThis tension has haunted the mind of man throughout\\nthe modern period. It was present from the beginning, as\\nwhen after sharp discussion involving the Theological\\nFaculty of the University of Leiden, in which city Des-\\ncartes had brought out his maiden Discours and had car-\\nried out experiments in anatomy, his works were barred\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 69\\n\\nfrom university use. The issue was felt at once; yet it was\\nphenomenally slow to find its accurate definition—if I am\\nright, has only recently found it. Its battle was therefore\\nfought on a variety of mistaken fronts—especially from\\nthe religious side as a warfare against science in general\\nand from the scientific side as a contest against “final\\ncauses” in general, It was fought through all pertinent\\nchannels—through literature, poetry, graphic art, politics\\n—as well as through philosophy. But it is in the broad lines\\nof philosophical effort, as in its nature the interpreter be-\\ntween human intuition and the sharpening techniques of\\nreason, that we can best see the meaning and changing\\nfortunes of the struggle.\\n\\nOnce Descartes had defined his two loci of certitude—\\nfor he had two, the I-exist and the mathematical rigor of\\nnature’s processes—the way was invitingly open to set up\\na system, either of pure objectivism (as of Hobbes) or of\\npure subjectivism (as of Malebranche and Berkeley). But\\nthe major thought works of the early era, those of Locke,\\nSpinoza, and Leibniz, arose from an unwillingness to\\nabandon either aspect, or to reduce one to the other. Each\\nheld firmly to what he considered the scientific enlighten-\\nment; each held in his own way to the realities of thought\\nand feeling, and to a ruling Reality within which man’s\\nmoral being can find a home.\\n\\nThe same is true of later speculative efforts, those of\\nKant and Hegel, those also of the present century with its\\nrecovered courage of metaphysical synthesis—Royce,\\nBergson, Whitehead: all of these arise from an unwilling-\\nness to surrender either aspect of the dilemma.\\n\\nThis unwillingness, most marked in the philosopher-\\nscientists—Leibniz, Newton, Kant—to whom the mathe-\\nmatical vision continued to hold a religious aura, was\\n70 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nshared from the side of Christianity as it gained a grasp of\\nits new responsibilities. It became unwilling to maintain\\nopposition to the findings of an empirical conscience which\\nitself had nursed into existence.* With this growing per-\\nception of its own stake in the majestic growth of the\\nedifice of scientific truth, the “warfare between science and\\nreligion” ceased to resound. Where can anything deserv-\\ning that name be found today?\\n\\nReligion must in any case hold to its fundamental con-\\nviction that nature is neither the whole nor self-explana-\\ntory. But Christianity has not been content with dogmatic\\ninflexibility. It has labored—no doubt with much groaning\\n—to incorporate into its world view the cosmological pic-\\nture being drawn trait by trait by the developing sciences,\\nevolution and all! It now rests its own case on solider\\nground than that of arbitrary intervention, the excep-\\ntional, the miraculous—namely, on the completer truth of\\nexperience. “Empiricism” is not the name of its enemy\\nunless empiricism is mounted, as positivism has attempted,\\non the vanishing knife edge of “the given,” the ideal “sense\\ndatum” from which all thought, all interpretation, all\\nmeaning is banished—that is to say, on the meaningless.”\\nThe broader empiricism, with which alone a consistent\\nscience can operate, the empiricism of meaning, of Hus-\\nserl’s Wesensschau, of the universal, is the potential friend\\nof religion, debouching as we have seen in the empiricism\\nof intersubjectivity. Here Christianity is at home.\\n\\nAt the same time, it may firmly call on the secular out-\\nlook to disavow its unscientific pronouncements in the field\\n\\n1 Op. cit., 25.\\n2\"Lompirisme en tant que philosophie de Vimmédiat se detruit lui-\\nmeme; Vimmédiat est inverse d’un principe d\\'intelligibitité”” Marcel,\\n\\nJournal Métaphysique, 8.

It may become a Christianity\\nself-aware in presence of a human need that increases, not\\ndiminishes, with that advance and with every humanistic\\nstep toward tangible as well as mental self-sufficiency.\\n\\nThroughout this entire three-century period of en-\\ncounter with the objective conscience of modern science,\\nChristianity has also experienced an eventful interaction\\nwith modern subjectivity.\\n\\nIt was in the nature of things that the firm certitude of\\nthe Cartesian I-think should present itself as a triumph of\\nthe spirit over matter, a guarantee of the soul’s immortal-\\nity, a refuge from the mechanical, a substantial basis for\\nthe demand for justice to the individual person, whose\\nrights Christianity had espoused from the beginning. The\\nexplicit idealisms of Leibniz and Berkeley, and also the\\nimplicit idealisms of Locke and Grotius in the field of law,\\nembodying these fruits of the subjective advance, tended\\nto confirm the general religious outlook, and were in turn\\nconfirmed by that outlook. Christianity recognized—as in\\nMalebranche—a philosophical rapprochement.\\n72 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThe subjective principle needed criticism and received\\nit freely, both within and without the philosophical current.\\nYet the inescapable I-think which absorbs “all my repre-\\nsentations” entered heavily into subsequent thought sys-\\ntems, even those seeking to escape it. This I-think is present\\nin, and sustains, not only the later idealisms from Kant to\\nBradley, Bosanquet, Royce, but also the pragmatisms of\\nJames and Dewey, the operationalisms of postrelativity\\nphysics (as with Bridgman), and at various points the\\nspeculations of Russell and the majestic synthesis of\\nWhitehead.*\\n\\nIt is not strange that Christian theology—if only on the\\nbroad platform that “Spirit creates and governs the\\n\\n3 Most explicitly in his “repudiation of the notion of vacuous actuality”\\n(Process and Reality, vill, 43, etc.), meaning thereby his denial that any\\nreal thing can be devoid of consciousness or some lesser grade of “sub-\\njective immediacy”: every real entity has inner self-feeling as its center\\nof being. Whitehead is much exercised to keep this subjective factor in\\nplace. Philosophy “is the self-correction by consciousness of its own initial\\nexcess of subjectivity” (22). In Science and the Modern World he de-\\nnounces “subjectivism” in the sense of the belief that “the world is in\\nme”: in Process and Reality he devotes an entire chapter to the theme\\n(Pt. II, ch. VII). Yet in his “Two Lectures on Life and Nature” at\\nChicago, he agrees that both propositions, “I am In the world” and\\n“The world is in me,” have their meed of validity. And his theory of\\n“prehensions,” as a modified version of Bacon’s suggestion that in nature\\nthings “apprehend” each other, is (as I understand it) a complete rejec-\\ntion of the physicalist theory of perception (P. & R. vill).\\n\\nHusserl, in his most revealing essay, Cartesian Meditations, now pub-\\nlished in his original German script as Die Pariser Vortrdge, has a\\nsimilar in-and-out relation to the omnivorous I-think. The “intentionality”\\nwhich gives my experience universality is itself, he holds, still a private\\naffair: “Alle Schoidungen, die ich mache zwischen echter und triigender\\nErfahrung und in ihr zwischen Sein und Schein, verlaufen in meiner\\nBewusetseinsephdre selbst... .” And in the end, though he fights to\\novercome solipsism, he fails to throw off the ever-recurring net of the\\nmonadic vision. His “monadologische Intersubjectivitdé” fails of being\\na thorough intersubjectivity, because he bases it only on the consubjec-\\ntivity of fellow monads, and not on the intersubjectivity of the universal\\nThou-art (Husserliana I, 81, 121 ff.).\\nCHRISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 13\\n\\nworld”—has at times inclined to affiliate itself with some\\nvariant of idealism.\\n\\nBut Christianity was bound to find idealism a broken\\nreed, as idealism was through the nineteenth century, an\\nidealism incompletely freed from the solipsistic taint. Since\\nthe first obligation of religion is to unite the individual\\nself with the real as Other Self, Christianity could have\\nno durable commitment to a scheme of thought whose ab-\\nsolute Thou-art remains a subjective postulate, or an ob-\\nject of feeling, or if found in history tends to disappear in\\na cultural mist, whether Hegelian, anthropological, or\\nsocial-historical. Until modern philosophy had found its\\nown solution of the dilemma, it was in the nature of things\\nthat Christianity should pass through a period of concern\\nto cleanse its skirts of “idealism.”\\n\\nBut this period of purification has done its work with\\nless than clear perception of the issue. The rejection of an\\nundefined “idealism,” fallaciously identified with the sub-\\njective principle itself, loses sight of an unyielding neces-\\nsity in all religion—that the clean aloneness of the sub-\\njective I-am, free from social involvement, must be the\\nstarting point of all religious experience, the measure of\\nits depth and vitality. Religious experience as a personal\\nconcern is “the redemption of solitude”: the individual “is\\nnot a mystic until his own spirit has made its solitary leap\\nto God, like a tongue of flame out of the midst of the fire.” *\\nThe present indiscriminate—almost fashionable—repudia-\\ntion of idealism by theology, granting its due grounds, not\\nonly loses a factor of immense power in the spirit of mo-\\ndernity, but stands to lose the path through which philoso-\\nphy has already remedied the defect and holds faith with\\nboth advances of modernity.\\n\\n“The Meaning of God, 402-4.\\nTh THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nWhat that path is we have already roughly traced.® In\\nthe guise of a “synthesis of idealism and realism” it has\\nlong been a philosophic ambition. The “objective” and “ab-\\nsolute” idealists following Kant were moved by it; the later\\nSchelling attempted it with some success. But the solving\\ndeed could not occur until philosophy was once more as\\nmuch at home with the spirit of science and with its tech-\\nnical instruments as it was in the seventeenth and eight-\\neenth centuries. With Fechner, Lotze, Poincaré, and\\nRoyce, philosophy once more entered this avenue; Charles\\nPeirce had glimpses of the way in which a solution must\\ncome; Whitehead has assumed a gigantic labor of recon-\\nstruction; and a generation of physicists, including Max\\nPlanck, Nils Bohr, Heisenberg, and C. F. v. Weizsaecker,\\nhas joined hands with philosophy in the task, which be-\\ncomes necessarily co-operative.\\n\\nBut the decisive step has required something more, and\\nsomething less, than a full absorption of scientific tech-\\nnique; namely, a deeper analysis of the empirical principle\\nitself such as we have indicated. And merging with this\\nwork, one current of philosophical inquiry, at points in\\ntouch with religious thought, has followed an independent\\nand devious path which has for us a special interest be-\\ncause, instead of repudiating subjectivism, it has taken the\\nunpromising road of an even more radical subjectivity. By\\nits unbridled and various nature it throws a vivid light\\nupon the quandary of our philosophical position, and on\\nthe relation of Christianity thereto. It will reward a look.\\n\\nIt originates—about the 1840’s—in a valiant dialectical\\nattempt to dethrone dialectic—the polemic of Kierkegaard\\n5 Above, pp. 80 et seq.\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 45\\n\\nagainst Hegel in the interest of the most inward crisis of\\nthe individual soul.\\n\\nThe root of Kierkegaard’s passionate concern for the\\nanxious world peril of the solitary self—first of all his own\\nself, yet as with Descartes conceived defiantly as the uni-\\nversal plight of man—lay long dormant. It slept beneath\\nthe noise of a kindred passion, professedly anti-Christian\\n—Nietzsche’s violent gospel of man-generating-the-\\nbeyond-man by inflicting surgery on himself: Geist ist das\\nLeben, das selber ins Leben schneidet. Reviving the old\\nroot, and still in the spirit of that self-overcoming Geist, a\\nphilosophy called Existentialism has been casting un-\\nordered shafts of light into the darkness of human exist-\\nence and destiny, leaving them for the most part in sharper\\ndarkness because of the shattered and defeated light.\\n\\nThe common element in this willfully branching move-\\nment lies in finding within the I-exist a depth of meaning\\nwhich the impoverished dictionary sense of “existing” or\\n“being” (and its terminal position at the tiptop of Por-\\nphyry’s tree) seems to forbid. It reminds us that our\\nexistence, definable or not, gets less tangible meaning\\npoint-blank than from a contrast, its contrast with a think-\\nable and possible nonewistence. My being borders on my\\nnonbeing at every angle. And as I peer into the bottomless\\ngulf of my nonbeing, I realize that it lies always within the\\nscope of my freedom to step off—into nothingness. All the\\npassion with which my will-to-live is freighted crowds itself\\ninto the narrow, fragile, arbitrary, perhaps indefensible\\nfact, I exist: at least my whole world is in it. Of a sudden\\nthe emptiest of concepts becomes the fullest; existence be-\\ncomes Ewistenz, passion-charged being.\\n\\nA solitary reflection! A solitary concern? The almost\\n76 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nwhimsical all-importance of this to-be-or-not-to-be I have\\nno choice but to impute to every I-exist in the universe: my\\nprivatest anxiety is every man’s, And were all such to\\nexercise at once their freedom not to be, would any mean-\\ning be left in the universe? ° Ewistenz, necessarily private-\\npersonal, becomes momentous, the one truly momentous\\nthing in the world. More intensely than for Descartes, the\\nT-exist declares itself a necessary beginning for philosophy\\n—-subjectivity to the extreme limit, not of thought alone\\nbut of passion as well. Perhaps one must add that, far less\\nthan Descartes, does Existentialism as a whole—if it is a\\nwhole—know what to do with this beginning.\\n\\nAmong the representatives of this trend,’ it is Gabriel\\nMarcel who has most perceptively pursued its logic to a\\nsolution—though with deliberate rejection of “system”—\\nand also to an understanding of his own with Christian\\ntradition. He has done so first in a personal journal (Jour-\\nnal Métaphysique, 1927), relating a mental journey that\\ntraverses the full length of the idealist thread in modern\\nphilosophy with which in earlier years he had been deeply\\nengaged. This with later works contains the story of his\\nemancipation from this idealism (“within an idealistic\\nframe,” he is careful to note), an emancipation helped by\\nhis studies with Bergson, and by other phases of that wider\\nempiricism whose outlines we have traced. And he reaches\\n—as most Existentialism does not—the crucial perception\\nof an intersubjectivity in which the objective and subjec-\\ntive insights of modernity are preserved and cured. In him\\n\\n* Heidegger, Sein und Zeit; Helmut Kuhn, Encounter with Nothing-\\nness. It is apparent that at this point Existentialism is tangent to the\\ninsight of Fechner above referred to p. 57), a contemporary of Kierke-\\n\\nrd.\\n\\n7 Though like others of scrupulous conscience, Marcel is now inclined\\nto disavow identification with so ambiguous a movement.\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE vis\\n\\nalone, of this trend, the subjective experiment comes full\\ncircle and reaches inner coherence.* At the same time—\\nand this is his special pertinence to the antisubjective issue\\n—Marcel has made it I might almost say his crusade to\\npreserve the clear essence of selfhood in its privacy and\\nfreedom from the grasp of technological objectivity and\\nthe pressures of a functional social milieu.®\\n\\nThrough Marcel, and through Etienne Gilson, who\\nstanding apart from Existentialism as a movement yet em-\\nbraces its issues with a discerning sympathy, finding in\\n‘Thomas Aquinas anticipation of Ewistenz, in the concrete\\nand living sense of the notion of being-as-act,\"® this move-\\nment substantially promotes a reconception of Christianity\\npointing beyond the limits of the modern era, preserving\\nit from an ultimately devastating antisubjectivism.\\n\\nNor must it be forgotten that the movement contains an\\n\\n* See my article above cited, “Marcel and the Ground Issues of Meta-\\nphysics,” 446f, and 451-60, Sartre does on occasion assert that the\\nawareness of self and of other-self are interdependent (as in L/Haisten-\\ntialisme est un Humanisme), yet his theory of angoisse appears to deny\\nthis insight.\\n\\n® See his Introduction to Jowrnal Métaphysique, xi: “La position que\\nfai cherchée & défintr ... consiste en effet a destituer la vérité de\\ncette valeur d’au-deld qu’un certain rationalieme automatiquement Iwi\\nconfére—et du méme coup 4 réndre a Vewisténce cette priorité méta-\\nphysique dont Vidéaliame a prétendu la priver. A cette égard, la distine-\\ntion de Vexisténce et de Vobjectivité présente selon moi une importance\\nimpossible & exagérer.” In brief, the real is not “au-deld,” but within\\nexperience; and the empirical is, at the same time, not swallowed up in\\nthe privacy of the I-think, nor the I-think in the observable otherness of\\nthe scientific “ébject.” See also his much later work, now done into\\nEnglish as Man and Mass Society.\\n\\n10 In his recent book, Being and Some Philosophers, Gilson points out\\nthat St. Thomas, in regarding God as the author of existence, declares\\nthis gift of existence to be the gift of a power of action. To exist, for\\nhuman beings, is to act as efficient causes; hence we may speak of the\\nact of ewisting, of esse as a verb-active rather than of ens as formal\\npresence-in-being. This insight certainly enters into the notion of\\nEBxistenz, in which also we find the tensions of cosmic concern, and of\\nwhat Marcel fitly terms exigence,\\n78 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nequally vigorous rejection of antiobjectivity, although,\\nlacking the insight that could fuse these two demands, it\\nhas split on this point. As I know from what I have seen\\nand felt, the power of this movement with the youth of a\\ncontinent devastated by World War II, as well as with a\\nwider public, lay largely in an uncompromising realism\\nwhereby the world revealed by science and hard fact is\\ntaken without demand for comfort, and without surrender\\nof the I-will that goes with the I-think. The refuge for the\\nstark objectivists, such as Sartre, was in no cosmic Thou-\\nart, but in the power of an absolute freedom-in-self to\\nshape and universalize its own values.\\n\\nThere is a dramatic excess in Sartre’s version of free-\\ndom ; its defiant Titanism proposing man as unlimited self-\\nmaker made-by-nothing stands in impossible contrast to\\nthe entities and events of nature, each made what it is by\\nall the rest, hence wholly dependent and unfree. Man also\\nis created; not self-evoked from Naught. But created man\\nbecomes man-the-creator ; and what he is, as created being,\\ncontains his power-to-create. This, his radical freedom,\\ncan only be measured against the full unfreedom of the\\ncause-tight mesh of physical nature. To this extent, the\\nfreedom and power of self-making pictured by Sartre be-\\nlong to the full truth into which we must grow.\\n\\nAnd that unfreedom against which it is measured must\\nbe retained with it: the phase of truth out of which the\\nnight view appears to emerge is as little abandonable as is\\nthe subjective advance. The two roots of modernity’s\\nmalaise belong together, not as dead but as living and\\ncomplementary—an aspect of that “principle of comple-\\nmentarity” through which Nils Bohr has proposed to unite\\nthe quantum and the wave, both of which enter into the\\nconstitution of radiant energy. It is only in their due union\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 719\\n\\nthat there can be a working remedy for the ills of both\\nabstractions.\\n\\nHow this union has been reached in the present century\\nfrom the philosophical side, I have already indicated in\\nbare outline. And this solution may guide us as we further\\ninquire how the union may be reached from the side of\\nreligion,\\n\\nI am far from proposing that it is primarily through\\nphilosophy that Christianity meets the issues presented by\\nmodernity. Philosophy is but a rude and remote indicator\\nof the secret struggles of countless human souls carrying\\non the query-laden enterprise of living under existing con-\\nditions. Religion meets these struggles directly. But the\\nphilosophy that lives, lives only because those who struggle\\nfind it helpfully interpreting that struggle. It is not some-\\nthing apart from religion—it is an organ of the human\\nthought without which religion is but a blind survival im-\\npulse, sometimes usurping the name of “faith”—which is\\nnever blind. Christianity, holding itself duly independent\\nof philosophy (and on occasion unduly despising it) ,** has\\nno choice but to come to terms with the concepts which the\\ntime spirit finds expressive of its own groping for light.\\n\\nWe may justly conclude therefore that in terms of the\\nspecific issues raised by modernity’s “bifurcation of\\nnature” the Christianity of the West has been actively re-\\nconceiving its own ground, taking a hesitant but promising\\npart in the total movement of thought beyond modernity.\\nIt is thus approaching a fitness to meet universally the\\nuniversal sources of disease. But since the experience and\\nthought leading to this self-revision are chiefly western\\n\\n1 As in Reinhold Niebuhr’s The Self and the Dramas of History, ch.\\nXII et seq.\\n80 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nexperience and thought, the question may still be raised, Is\\nChristianity universal? Or is it deepened in its westernism\\nby this very struggle?\\n\\nWe must give this question its full scope and careful\\ndefinition.\\n\\nili. Christianity’s Involvement in Western Life\\n\\nA RELIcIon is always more than a scheme of thought.\\nAnd though usually less than an ideology, it is involved\\nwith the whole organism of the culture it animates. Western\\nreligion has, for over three centuries, had the unique advan-\\ntage of constant intercourse with a science and a philo-\\nsophical activity independent of itself, and yet relevant to\\nits being. Largely through this free intercourse it has\\nmoved toward solving insights which, made part of its own\\nvital impulse, promise to give it curative impact on any\\nmodern society. Yet this whole historic process, and its in-\\nvolvement in western culture, may tend to localize it. And\\nif Christianity as a whole is distinctively western, its signifi-\\ncance for world civilization is—I will not say nullified from\\nthe start, but discounted.\\n\\nAnd not alone for the Orient. For western man is no\\nmore capable than eastern man of accepting a religion\\nlocalized as western. What every man knows is that religion\\nis and has to be cosmic business, not hemispherical nor\\notherwise limited in its competence to interpret and to\\naddress the God of all mankind.\\n\\nThe day of private and local religions is over. It is over\\nby almost general consent—except as their history has\\nfurnished special vessels for national feeling, of which I\\nshall have more to say. What we see now as local religions\\nare so, for the most part, only because the world has grown\\nup around their original spheres then considered total.\\nCHEISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 81\\n\\nThey now tend to break out of these domains. Hinduism\\nhas its missionary Vedanta; Islam has its Ahmadiyya;\\neven Shinto has (or had) its Tenrikyo with a mission to\\nCalifornia! Jealous gods and chosen peoples are normal\\nchiefly within an accepted polytheism no longer thinkable.\\n\\nThe original proponents of a religious insight may\\nfairly consider themselves “chosen,” as holders of a “de-\\nposit of faith” defining a historic mission. Churches of a\\ndivinely ordained and continued episcopate incline to\\nestablish boundaries of acceptance similar in principle and\\neffect, as establishing inner criteria lacking to an indis-\\ncriminate universalism. But the “chosen” in this sense are\\nchosen to cancel their own chosenness through the spread of\\ntheir own insight to all men. The good faith of chosenness\\nis thus that it banishes its own distinction: hugged to itself\\nit becomes an ally of religious hybris and corruption.\\n\\nIt remains true that religion—never an abstract uni-\\nyversal—has to involve the whole man in his existing en-\\ngagement with a historic community. It must address itself\\nto the universal plight of the human soul; but the actual\\nindividual has to recognize his own personal plight in that\\nuniversal description. The local experience of the specific\\ncommunity will paint itself into those terms. If Buddha ad-\\ndresses mankind as suffering, each Indian listener must\\nneeds read his own Indian suffering into the sermon: if a\\nreligion of Law addresses men as sinners, each one must\\nfind his own sense of sin, or lose the point of the appeal. If\\nthere are whole communities or whole peoples who have no\\n“sense of sin” or find such a sense hard to acquire (we\\nrecall Vivekananda’s striking cry before the Parliament\\nof Religions in 1893: “ ‘Sinners’! It is a sin to call men\\nsinners !”?)—a religion whose mission is to “save sinners”\\ncannot be psychologically universal without first making\\n82 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nuniversal the moral exigency to which it ministers. A reli-\\ngion can hardly escape being qualified by the world-and-\\nself intuitions of the people through which it has developed,\\n\\nIf, then, Christianity and western civilization have\\ngrown up together, the universality of its terms—if they\\nare universal—will not wholly relieve it from provincial\\ncoloring. We must therefore look beyond the sphere of\\nphilosophical and scientific problem-setting, and consider\\nit in its broad relation to western history and experience.\\n\\nChristianity and western civilization have indeed grown\\nup together. It is perhaps fair to say that there is no phase\\nof western culture that has not been nursed by this religion\\ninto a renewal of life after the Dark-Age period of confu-\\nsion. We have taken the birth of scientific method as\\ntypical, though it is among the latest. We might have taken\\nlaw, education, the family, forms of property, architecture,\\nengineering, music . . . Here, as elsewhere in the world,\\nall of these arts have borne marks of their religious parent-\\nage, and religious expression has been modified by occupa-\\ntion with these arts.\\n\\nBut here more than elsewhere, all these arts have re-\\nvolted from the maternal domination. As definable spheres\\nof interest “for their own sakes,” they have rejected the\\necclesiastical restriction. And here more than elsewhere\\nthis emancipation has been fairly complete, and has been\\na signal for new life, fertility, invention. And with this, a\\ndiscovery of their own independent principles of being, as\\n“secular” arts, strengthening and being strengthened by\\nthe secular outlook of the modern age. If this freedom\\nmeans finding a more universal voice, it is possible that the\\nlocal peculiarity of westernism in these fields is its ap-\\nproach to the intrinsically universal!\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 83\\n\\nWe must, however, add that here, as nowhere else, the\\nrill of creative liberty, cut off from the motive spring of\\nworld passion in which every art is born, has tended to\\nrun out into shallow artefact: something essential has been\\nlost. But meanwhile—and this is what here concerns us—\\nthrough their new-won autonomy the secularized arts have\\nrendered the religion signal service by their criticism from\\nthe standpoint of their discovered light.\\n\\nScience has done its share, as we observed, in bringing\\nreligion to trim away elements of superstition, and to\\ntransmute into metaphor and poetry certain indispensable\\nitems of myth and imagination which as dogma clash with\\nthe free course of legitimate science. Civil law has sobered\\nand humanized canon law. The humanist conscience has\\nco-operated with the Christian conscience first to define,\\nthen to correct and curb, a legally workable doctrine of\\nhuman rights. The freed fine arts have found new mate-\\nrials, new techniques, new instruments, and withal new\\nprinciples—in some points reaching out to a community\\nof meaning with the fine arts of all lands.\\n\\nJust to the degree in which these spheres of culture have\\nfound universality through their independence, western\\ncivilization in ceasing to be specifically Christian has also\\nceased to be specifically western, and to that extent has\\naided Christianity itself to divest itself of provincialism. In\\nso far as each art finds its own lingua franca, and in so far\\nas literature, without losing its spice of identifiable idiosyn-\\ncrasy, becomes in Goethe’s sense world literature, religion\\ncannot fail to discover its own art of speaking its message\\nto mankind in terms of a human, not western, psychology.\\n\\nI say “in so far”; and the qualification is necessary. The\\nindependence of the arts has not infallibly meant the dis-\\ncovery of the universal. Freedom from churchly limitations\\n84 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhas sometimes meant discovery of standards, sometimes the\\nrejection of all standards, trying to live experimentally\\nwith none at all! It has here and there misjudged self-\\nruling as an invitation to self-norming, and has thus\\nblinded itself to the sense of its own message to mankind. ©\\nIt is just the universal that is in danger of being lost; and\\nwestern civilization, suffering under an exaggerated self-\\ntrust amounting to a worship of man-unleashed, cracks.\\nFreedom is not enough; and, as Toynbee asserts, repent-\\nance is due. Without standard, no art, no right, no truth,\\nno joy in living, no civilization to transmit! And without\\npassion, no standard. The free arts must in some sense re-\\ntain or regain their rootage in the universal as passion, i.e.,\\nin religion.\\n\\nBut does this mean a return to Christianity? Or has the\\nrevision of Christianity under the critiques of its own\\nemancipated offspring—guided and misguided—has this\\nincessant work of reconception brought Christianity to a\\nsimple coincidence with the general idea of religion, from\\nwhich the accidents of its own history fall away? The total\\neffect of its western experience would be, in that case, the\\nemergence of the essential divested of the local—the\\nachievement of its history the overcoming of history. If we\\nhesitate to accept this result, do we not confess that, with\\nall the clarification of its essential certitudes, Christianity\\nremains western, while the West has largely ceased to be\\nChristian?\\n\\nThe argument is impressive. It calls a response from all\\nour hopes for purity and simplicity in whatever constitutes\\nthe institutional embodiment of our idea of the holy ; from\\nall within us that rebels against the complexities of dogma,\\nthe venalities of organization, and the intricate dust-\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 85\\n\\ncovered treasures of the supernatural garret. Yet it har-\\nbors a fallacy.\\n\\nI find that fallacy most clearly understood through the\\nanalogy of positive law; for law, like religion, has its uni-\\nversals which through history work toward clarification\\nand power, as toward an ideal that would make a history of\\nlaw—not superfluous, but as nearly unnecessary to the\\nunderstanding of law as the history of mathematics is to\\nthe understanding of mathematics. But positive law, while\\naccepting the ideal of inner universality, cannot shed its\\nhistory: like every product of a growing life, it bears its\\nhistory in itself. So a positive religion. When we recover\\nfrom the reverse superstition, to the effect that an eternal\\ntruth, an @ priori principle perhaps, must in the nature of\\nthe case be always known; when we recognize that the\\neternal truths, especially those of practical reason, have to\\nhave their human discoverers, announcers, messengers,\\nhence their birthdays and the ups-and-downs of their ap-\\nplications, their eventful careers; we understand that the\\nvision of the eternal—not the eternal itself—must have its\\nhistory. And this history, in its own nature, tends rather to\\nillustrate than to obstruct or distort the nature of the\\n“principle” thus embodied. The issue is not whether Chris-\\ntianity can put off its history, its western involvement; it is\\nwhether with this its inescapable biography, it can so pre-\\nsent the valid essences of religion as to give them unim-\\npeded force, able to meet the issues created everywhere by\\nthe abstract universals of the secularized arts and sciences.\\n\\nOne test of this requirement is the test of simplicity;\\nfor the simple is not an empty unity devoid of detail, it is\\na unity declaring its power to integrate complexity. What\\nwe have to ask of Christianity is whether it is thus sim-\\nplified, purged, disciplined—qualified by its own bitter\\n86 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nordeal to descend into the pits dug for mankind by its own\\nfollowers, and to save them there. Something like this was,\\nI believe, the purport of a remark by Hu Shih, as we talked\\ntogether one March day in 1932, in the hospital of Peking\\nUnion Medical College, where we happened both to be\\ncasual patients. Hu Shih, not disposed to specific religion,\\nremarked objectively of Christianity that it was “rela-\\ntively simple and pure.” He meant, I think, that it had—as\\na factor in Chinese life at that time—learned to emphasize\\na few things as essential ; and that it was comparatively free\\nfrom what Father Doré called Les Superstitions Chinoises,\\nand from the abuses of the prevailing “funeral rackets.”\\nIt was, he agreed, a westernizing influence, weaning many\\nof its followers too much away from sympathy with the\\ntraditions, and from concern with the then current issues,\\nof Chinese life; but he considered—I think with much\\nmagnanimity—that the deflection was temporary and un-\\nimportant as compared with the clarifying and motivating\\nof young Chinese minds, and that “they would find their\\nway back.” Hu Shih was a wise enough judge of human\\nnature to know that ideas, even the simplest and truest, do\\nnot work in a vacuum.\\n\\nBut whether Christianity is in fact prepared to meet the\\ncoming civilization as clarified messenger of the universal,\\nthis we cannot answer by assuming that we are ourselves\\nclear and at one as to what the essence of Christianity is.\\nWe must again inquire, What is Christianity?\\n\\niv. What Christianity Is\\n\\nTue recurrent quest for the “essence of Christianity”\\nmust not overlook the fact that the original Gospel is al-\\nready an essence, and proclaims itself as such. I venture to\\nCHRISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 87\\n\\nsay that among sacred books the Christian scriptures are\\nunique for the pervasive spirit of induction, announcing a\\nsingle generating principle (or essence) from which the\\nvarious items of a complex long-growing tradition can be\\ndeduced.” The Golden Rule, for example, is expressly an-\\nnounced as such an induction, “for this és the law and the\\nprophets.”. The profound impact of the message of Jesus\\nwas due in no small measure to the masterful way in which\\nearlier rules and doctrines were thus caught up in an\\nessential simplicity, and illuminated thereby.\\n\\nNow a powerful induction is no result of following log-\\nical rules—pace the textbooks, there are no rules! It\\ncomes as a stroke of insight, after long thoughtful mulling\\nover the data, which—under new light from God knows\\nwhere, probably an intimation of necessity—reconceives\\nthose data. The teaching of Jesus as a whole is an induc-\\ntive reconception of the faith of the Hebrew lawgivers,\\nprophets, and poets. I say “reconception” because his in-\\nductions at once integrate the tradition and extend it, not\\nhesitating to correct points of tradition that deviate from\\nthe discerned principle, nor to rebuke a blind literalism in\\nfollowing the letter of the law; and doing this confidently,\\n“as one having authority,” because the grasp of essence\\nadmits for the first time an entrance into what the tradi-\\ntion really means.

It does indeed\\nappeal to broad characters of human experience, and to reason; its\\nopening announcements are inductive generalizations not from the old\\nrules but from the human lot, pointing out the pervasiveness of suffering\\nin a sense not wholly alien to that of the Existentlalists. The Buddha\\nmade no attempt to bring the Fourfold Truth or the Eightfold Path to\\na single principle, unless the “middle path” is such a principle.

It is set apart, in the teaching before us,\\npartly by its affirmative form which taken literally puts it\\nbeyond all possible observance, and partly by the compre-\\nhensive claim that in this form it can summarize the rest of\\nthe law. The common rule of reciprocity, the injunction to\\nput oneself in the place of the recipient of one’s act, stands,\\nI think always, as one precept among many. As an induc-\\ntion summarizing the whole law, the golden rule takes\\nplace in the field of morals with the second and third of\\nthose universal principles of natural law, which Justinian\\nadopts from Ulpian, honeste vivere, neminem laedere,\\ncuique sum tribuere—live honorably, harm no one, render\\neveryone his due; but with the ethical addition of initiative\\ngood will.\\n\\nThe Golden Rule is a precept for action. More charac-\\nteristic of Christianity is the precept for feeling, “Thou\\nshalt love God and neighbor,” appearing in Leviticus\\namong many items, here singled out as the master key, an\\nessence. This precept of love would contain the Golden Rule\\nas a corollary—it is a wider induction. But as a rule for\\nfeeling it appears to call for another impossibility—con-\\ntrol of the uncontrollable: for who can regulate at will his\\nloving or not-loving?\\n\\n*8 And in another context the law of Tao beyond the rule of Jen,\\nbenevolence.

But he was essentially right: it is precisely the\\nbusiness of a religion to turn the world upside down, by making revolu-\\ntionary demands on motivation that have to be mace, leaving the question\\nof practicability to the subject and the higher powers. And Nietzsche,\\nwho proposed to transvalue all values in the reverse direction, entered\\nthe lists with Jesus Christ in the field of religion, He thought he was\\nopposing Christian slave morality; but he was, in fact, opposing a dry rot\\nof Chtistian morale whose correction in due time will fortify the con-\\nception of Christianity. See below, p. 94,\\n\\n15 A far-off anticipation of what is today just dawning on politics and\\nindustry that it is not enough to do what you have to do—you must do It\\n“and like it”! Otherwise you don\\'t really do it—a distinct renunciation\\nof behaviorism, also of Kant\\'s view that law can ignore motivation, and\\nof Spencer\\'s dictum, “We can do as we please—we cannot do anything\\nelse—but we cannot please as we please.”\\n\\nNow a political requirement to enthuse, when you do not enthuse, like\\na conventional requirement to be amiable when you are not amiable, can\\nbe the most painful of infringements on human freedom, suitable only\\nto the totalitarian conceptions of the scope of government. It is only in\\nreligion that a demand to love can be in order, and a failure to love be\\ndeemed a sin; for these standards are first of all standards for self-\\njudgment, not for the police court.\\n90 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nas actions but as wishes. And it culminates in a summary,\\nitself an induction unifying these several demands, “Be ye\\ntherefore perfect,” leaving the impression that the\\nTeacher, fully aware that his precepts were exceeding the\\npossibilities of poor human nature, was also aware that as\\nTeacher he could do no other than speak for the full re-\\nquirement which that same human nature in quiet clarity\\nmust hold over itself. For to have any standard, and to\\nhave a standard of perfection in that field, are not two\\nthings but one.\\n\\nThis intention of the Teacher is implied in another\\nsummary precept which, calling for a further impossi-\\nbility, seems to recognize the prior impossibilities: “Ye\\nmust be born again.” For by some spiritual rebirth, and\\nonly thereby, could one’s disposition-of-feeling so far\\nchange as to rise to the love of one’s enemies, or to that dis-\\ntinctively Christian summons to forgiveness, which like\\nthe “perfection” attributed in the Sermon to the Heavenly\\nFather refuses to follow the line of legal justice—forgive-\\nness being definable as a will to be unjust in order, by\\neliciting a new temper in the case, to achieve a deeper\\njustice. Here the Teacher deliberately enters the field of\\nmoral paradox, a field which had remained closed to all but\\nthe greater mystics.\\n\\nAnd as if to bring together his own several inductions\\nwithin a master induction, which is also a paradox, we have\\nthe dictum, “He that loseth his life for my sake, the same\\nshall save it.” In this expression, the words “for my sake”\\nindicate an essential factor of the thought; namely, the\\naffirmative power of a purposeful devotion, without which\\nthe blank formula “Die to live” gropes for foothold in the\\nwill. So understood, this precept can contain the others.\\nLove itself is a losing of the life of the sole-self within the\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 91\\n\\nlife of another and completer self, and in that loss finding\\nrealization.\\n\\nDoes this far-reaching induction, then, cover the whole\\nof the ethical code of Christianity? It brings to a focus the\\nsense of the new teaching, its element of rebuke to the\\nresidual worldliness of the older codes, its radical demand\\nto “forsake all and follow me.” But further, it joins direc-\\ntion with much of the moral aspiration of mankind in and\\nbeyond the Jewish tradition. Do we not find human nature\\nstruggling everywhere with the complementary paradox\\nthat self-assertion—having the full sanction of natural\\nimpulse—is self-defeating? And in the special instance of\\nrequiting evil with good—which is losing the pugnacious\\nself in order to find it—we have the words of Plato and of\\nLao Tze, Lao Tze adding the reason “that good may be\\ncreated.” We may fairly ask whether the ‘Teacher has not,\\nin this precept, offered an interpretation not only of the\\nessence toward which Judaism was striving, but of a uni-\\nversal striving of mankind, This universal striving we\\nmight call *° a striving beyond sole-selfhood and its nature-\\ndefined desires, an inescapable awareness that the assertive\\nwill fastens upon the asserter something less than the\\nwholeness of being to which he is called.\\n\\nWe shall for the moment leave this as a question. For the\\nTeacher, speaking in paradox, offers no total guide to life.\\nThe “struggle for existence” had not raised its imperative\\nhead so impressive to later centuries; the economic prob-\\nlem, whether for self or neighbor, is not solved by simple\\nneglect ; and the content of that greater will in which self-\\nwill is to be sublimated is left undefined, except in the\\nsweeping phrase “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God.”\\n\\n48 With Robert Ulich, a striving for self-transcendence: The Human\\nCareer, 1955,\\n92 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nFulfillment of code requiring world view: faith and ex-\\nperience, But a religion is, in any case, something more\\nthan a code of morals. Especially a religion whose moral\\ndemands are so palpably out of reach—be born again, be\\nperfect, be as a little child—must contain an answer to the\\nquestion, How is their fulfillment possible? Its essence will\\nbe found in the answer to this question and not in the\\ncode only.\\n\\nThe answer cannot be found in the idea of duty: it must\\nlie in a disclosure of the nature of the world. For a demand\\nupon feeling calls for a transformation of desire; and\\ndesire, formed in us by nature, can be transformed only\\nby a vision of unsuspected beauty and meaning in the\\nheart of things. If man can somehow fall in love with the\\nReal, as source of life, he may fall out of love with his\\nself-absorbed self; and it is hard to see how else he can\\nbe “reborn” in the orientation of his affections.\\n\\nIn other words, rebirth, not being something a person\\ncan do—hence an impossible object of command—is not\\nimpossible as an experience. But it must come to a person\\nas all values come—through discovery, through an en-\\ncounter with some character in things that elicits spon-\\ntaneous allegiance. The issue is the same today as in\\nancient times, though the language is different. Contempo-\\nrary psychiatry, occupied in its own way with changing mo-\\ntivation, speaks of a need for “integration,” will-focus-\\ning, and asks in effect how integration can be achieved.\\nJohn Dewey offers an answer. In his notable essay, A\\nCommon Faith, he avers with great candor that the human\\nperson cannot integrate himself: he must find in his en-\\nvironment an activity that sustains and unifies his ideal\\nends. These our ideal ends have their own intrinsic author-\\nity; but they must not be “rootless ideals, fantasies,\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 93\\n\\nutopias”: there must be in the universe natural conditions\\nthat promote “an active relation between ideal and ac-\\ntua! 2927\\n\\nTaking the world at its surface value, it is quite possible\\nnot to find any such will-moving character. The comment\\n“T find much in the world to call out my curiosity, even my\\nwonder, nothing that calls out my reverence” easily finds\\necho. It is to this impoverished world sense that Christian-\\nity has spoken. In presence of the Roman lostness, con-\\nvinced chiefly by power, it has represented the ultimate\\npower as an active love—not a distant cosmic benevolence,\\nbut an aggressive will, seeking more than the confidence,\\nthe response of each individual soul. Most improbable!\\nYet in that response lay the moment of the demanded\\nrebirth, the condition of the peace of each such soul: it\\nalone could be his “salvation.” **\\n\\n17 4 Common Faith, 18 ff., 51. Have we not here an honorable lapse\\ninto metaphysics?\\n\\n18In agreement with this need for an outer Real, which makes of\\nreligion something more than the dutiful service of moral ideals as\\nabstract universals, Royce places the “Problem of Christianity” in the\\nrelation of each person to a Community, whose spirit is the interpreter\\nof his moral experience. This experience is one of loyalty and disloyalty,\\nof isolation, alienation, despair, of redemption through vicarious suffer-\\ning of the atoning and interpreting spirit. No one, I think, has more\\ndeeply understood the passion of the early church, and its permanent\\nmeaning for humanity. No one has so wisely lifted the Pauline legalisms\\nto the level of the dialectic of a loyalty inseparable from love. In Royce’s\\nthought, the Christian virtues take their due place as universals of the\\nmoral life of man. Their meaning and fulfillment would seem to depend\\non the actual existence of such a Community. Royce’s discussion leaves\\nopen the question whether his Interpreter has historic identity or whether\\nit remains in the realm of an ideal society like the brotherhood of all\\ntrue Stoics. Its ideality doubtless remains purer and its reach more\\nunlimited if it be an object of faith rather than of sight; the historic\\nsoon ceases to be Immaculate. But in that case, the figure of Jesus, the\\nprime mover, retreats behind that of Paul, the architect of the com-\\nmunity’s moral hierarchy. In my view, Christianity is committed to the\\nradical step into the historic particular as the completion of its concept\\nof incarnation as an actualized ideal. Otherwise it is not literally true\\n94 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThe essence of the Christian world view is this most\\nunlikely doctrine about the nature of Being, that the most\\nReal is the all-loving. If through his own perception one\\ndiscovers this to be the case, the essence of the Christian\\ncode becomes possible, even imperative—namely, that\\ndesire itself be changed—that self and world be “over-\\ncome” through a love that suffers in order to create, seeing\\nthe neighbor now as what he is—not only, with Kant, as a\\nfree being, hence requiring respect; and not alone as an\\nobject of divine regard, hence calling out love and service ;\\nbut also as himself having something of the divine in hin—\\n“ye have done it unto me”—hence worthy of reverence,\\n“even the least of these.” This the deepest reach of the\\nChristian ethic is an immediate consequence of the deepest\\nreach of its world view, whereby each person participates\\nin the life of God.\\n\\nThe world view and the code are inseparable.\\n\\nTwo aspects of this view call for special comment, the\\nplace of suffering and the meaning of “perception.”\\n\\nAs to the place of suffering:\\n\\nWhile there is no Christianity without the acceptance\\nof suffering, as implied by the symbol of the Cross, Chris-\\ntianity is not primarily sacrifice—it is power through\\nsacrifice. The goal is not defeat of the human will, but\\nvictory of the transformed will. The ethic of Christianity\\ncannot be read in literal applications of the Sermon on the\\nMount in its clear-cut contrasts with what “hath been said\\nby them of old time”—in deliberate “hard sayings,”\\nhyperbole in the field of behavior used in order to compel\\nattention to the realities of motive, e.g., if thy right hand\\n\\nthat the ideal is in the actual, and is the ultimate power of the history in\\nwhich were immersed. See below pp. 119-24.\\nCHRISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 95\\n\\noffend thee cut it off ; take no thought for the morrow. On\\ntheir face these are not “counsels of perfection”; they are\\ncounsels of immorality. The ethic of Christianity is not\\naltruism nor mere pacifism nor drifting-in-idleness. It is\\nsuperiority to the efficiently trivial, the reputably prudent,\\nand the timorously pious. It is the prophetic conscious-\\nness °—a command of events through hard-won identity\\nwith the deeper realities, the eternal conditions of eternal\\ngood. The goal is the ineffable joy of one who has created\\nsomething immortal because the quality of integrity is in\\nit. Its life is the spur of co-operation with the absolute,\\nat whatever pain and through whatever opposition. This\\nis finding and doing one’s task as the will of God; it is the\\nworking version of “Thy Kingdom come”; it is also love\\nto one’s neighbor. For, as Nietzsche has truly said, in one\\nof his unconscious tangencies with Christianity, “Great\\nlove is, the beloved to create; and all creators are hard,”\\nfirst of all to themselves. To Jesus of Nazareth, his Way\\nwas one, not of acquiescence, but of sternly decisive oppo-\\nsition to the hypocrites and the money-changers: it was a\\nwill to create through suffering. That will is the essence\\nof the Christian ethic.\\n\\nAs to the meaning of “perception”:\\n\\nI have said that the Christian ethic implies a “most un-\\nlikely world view”—unlike what we perceive. With every\\nreligion, but more explicitly than most, it makes appeal to\\n“faith”; and faith at once suggests a confidence in some-\\nthing not perceived, a repudiation of what common-sense\\nempiricism would report of the facts—passing, confused,\\nand recklessly unjust. To a serious and conscientious real-\\nism, there may be something not alone softly optimistic\\n\\n19 The Meaning of God, ch. XXXII, 501 ff.\\n96 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nbut downright unscrupulous in believing good of such an\\nobviously mixed world.\\n\\nFaith is indeed often a rejection of what appears in-\\ndubitable—‘the rea] world cannot be so cruel and so\\nfutile as this”’—a postulate, not a perception. It is char-\\nacteristically directed to another and better world, a world\\nof supernature, heaven, whose character cannot be in-\\nferred from any laws of nature—this nature. Yet I am\\nasserting the further paradox that faith, however far it\\nreaches, cannot hold itself apart from either natural rea-\\nson or natural experience; and yet that at its source it is\\na mode of perception. I affirm that what we have a right to\\nbelieve of the real depends on what we can see of its inner\\nnature.\\n\\nLet me point out first that no one lives without suffer-\\ning, nor without the faith that carries that suffering. The\\n“will to create through suffering” is not the will of the\\nexceptional, the heroic, the saintly: it is the will present in\\nthe labor of man and in the travail of woman. The faith\\nthat supports these sufferings and turns the two curses of\\nGenesis into the pride of the race is simply the unbreakable\\nthong of connection between the remonstrating tissues and\\nthe sense of the goal as the glory of the human lot. Some-\\nthing is borne because something is being born. Nature\\nand history, not known but felt, hold silent fellowship with\\nthese passages of anguish, and the sufferer aware of their\\npresence cannot doubt the meaning of his pain. There is\\nsomething elemental, call it the élan vital, that faces every\\nnew experience with the impetus of past generations,\\ncarrying with it the original substance of things hoped\\nfor: it lives by faith. And this faith is less a theory than a\\nperception.\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 97\\n\\nFaith as a tension against appearances can be defined as\\na reversed skepticism, a refusal to be taken in by the first\\nlook of experience. In this sense faith is a natural ally of\\nall thought, an ingredient of thought, as science pursues\\nits adventure far beyond the borders of the imaginable.\\nThe deus absconditus, the concealed absolute, of the scien-\\ntist lies indeed in a different direction from that of the\\nsoul seeking the moral realities—they are asking different\\nquestions. But they are alike concerned with power—\\nalways invisible—the one with power in nature, the soul\\nwith the ultimate power. It is a part of ancient wisdom\\nthat the ultimate powers are averse to display—the most\\npowerful the least self-assertive. In the Hebrew prophets\\nand in the greater mystics, the Almighty is in the still,\\nsmall voice, or in the nonaction of Tao. If Christianity\\ndevelops this theme symbolically in the weakness of the\\ndivine babe, the humility of the carpenter, the poverty\\nand homelessness of the man of sorrows, the public dis-\\ngrace of the condemned, forsaken and crucified, laying in\\nfutility itself the foundation of an invincible kingdom, it is\\nbut giving narrative embodiment to an insight with which\\nin principle neither ancient wisdom nor the latest science\\nhas any quarrel. Christianity presents its narrative as\\nthe clue to the world riddle, and as such, an object of\\nfaith.\\n\\nBut the faith which Christian ethic requires is some-\\nthing more than a faith in a principle. It is this, but it is\\nalso—if you will permit the word—a faith in fact ; that is\\nto say, in the particular and present drive of experience.\\nThe faith of the pioneer settler, of the artisan at his labor,\\nof the artist at his easel, of the woman in childbirth, yes,\\nof the child also in his will to “grow up,” is not faith in a\\ngenerality. It is an immediate perception of, and commit-\\n98 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nment to, the forward thrust of being, in this particular\\npresent world of hidden powers, felt but inarticulate. This\\nneyer-assertive but never-absent metaphysical sense of\\nprocess-and-direction to which all action trusts itself is, I\\ndare say, the most primitive form of faith object; and our\\ncommitment thereto the dimmest version of natural reli-\\ngion. But it may point to the one matter that now concerns\\nus, that religion is always in the last analysis autobio-\\ngraphical: “This one thing I know.” And my proposal is\\nthat until one thus knows by seeing he has neither the\\nright nor the power to “believe.”\\n\\nThe good faith of a religion will then appear in its\\nappeal to experience, first that of its prophet as an exam-\\nple of his own teaching, then that of each believer, For\\nChristianity this means that God’s work and love are per-\\nceivable by each human being—not as past history—but\\nin his own way and context and time. “Behold, I stand at\\nthe door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open\\nthe door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and\\nhe with me.” The “any man” is significant. To make these\\ntwo words good, the being who speaks them—here called\\n“the Spirit”—must be, as the man of Nazareth could not\\nbe, omnipresent in space and time—as it were an unbound\\nand unlimited Christ, pervasive of the world and of his-\\ntory, like the Logos of John’s Gospel who “was in the\\nbeginning with God,” and at the same time universally\\naccessible—more than that, universally initiative of the\\npersonal relation. The scope of this great saying, to my\\nmind the most impressive coming out of the experience of\\nthe early church, enlarges as we dwell on it: it is unexam-\\npled in its union of unlimited sweep with its complete self-\\ngiving to each individual soul, however circumstanced.\\n‘The concept of the Christ involves the idea of a mediator\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 99\\n\\nbetween man and God, an idea which historic mysticism\\nhas often been disposed to reject on the ground that each\\nindividual must find his own way to God in immediate\\nexperience. But every religion, including every variant of\\nmysticism, is a way to this immediacy: reaching the non-\\nmediated is a passage beyond mediation, by aid of that\\nmediation. A purely immediate experience would be empty\\nof meaning: our most nearly immediate experience, self-\\nawareness, is mediated by the current rill of sensation and\\nthe contents of memory and purpose. To find God in im-\\nmediate experience, which is indeed the substance of reli-\\ngion as experience, is therefore to find him through some\\nmediation. If “the heavens declare the glory of God,” it is\\nnature that here serves as mediator. The concept of the\\nChrist is the concept of a personal being whose presence\\n“declares the glory of God” with the more adequate imme-\\ndiacy of companionship: “I will come in to him and sup\\nwith him, and he with me.” If the author of the Johannine\\nEpistles is right, love itself is a mediator: “Every one that\\nloveth is born of God,” and genuine love bears out this\\nradical assertion. The Christ concept has its legitimate\\nconcentration; but also its legitimate release, important\\nfor the age to come, and in this passage strikingly made a\\npart, though a neglected part, of Christian teaching.\\nThrough these words, the Christian concept of religion\\nrecognizes that the lone ego in its exigency requires, not\\nsolely the truths of a philosophical generality, and not\\nonly a historical example of its code realized in an authen-\\ntic life, but also each man’s personal discovery that the\\nostensibly indifferent world conceals, as its reality, an\\nintimate and individual concern for that ego, as of parent\\nfor child. This discovery can only be a person-by-person\\nevent, since it is the irreducible I-am that has to confirm\\n100 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe presence of an actual Thou-art, at the nucleus of its\\nexperience. It is there.”\\n\\nSuch an experience of personal discovery would be a\\nsufficient answer to the hostile or secret-hiding appear-\\nances whether of fortune’s brute fact, or of the scientific\\nnight view, or of the now opening astrophysical vistas that\\ntend to bury beneath unthinkable immensities all signifi-\\ncance of mankind and of man’s eccentric planet. These\\njudgments of vanishing worth are the illusions of a falla-\\ncious empiricism, valid in its field but partial and unseeing.\\nThe personal answer—the mystic’s answer—is the genuine\\nempiricism, to those who find it, sufficient and unlosable,\\nand at the same time in its nature valid for all.\\n\\nFor the “mystic” here is simply that “any man” in any\\nreligion who opens the door of his self-built enclosure, and\\nsees the world, perhaps for the first time, in his own experi-\\nence, as not his alone but God’s world, and therewith every\\n\\n20 This extraordinary sonnet, “Light of Men,” published only after\\nCharles Rann Kennedy\\'s death, brings into juxtaposition—almost into\\nunion—three factors of motivation: one’s own effort toward perfection;\\nthe demand of perfection as an outer “agonist” struggling with the self;\\nthe Logos of John’s Gospel as an unbound Christ:\\n\\nIil-furnished though I am, I yet insist\\n\\nUpon perfection, something which I see\\nComing my way distinctly, meant for me,\\nMy sole salvation gleaming through the mist.\\nBehold Him yonder, the dread agonist\\n\\nThat ever strives with me: yea, knee to knee\\nBreast against breast one heartbeat, vis-a-vis,\\nFlaming with joy of battle, keeping tryst!\\nHe is the light that burns in every man\\n\\nThat comes into the world!

Such seeing is not a rare and privileged\\nevent; it is not unnatural; it is a passing from the un-\\nnatural to the natural and true. It is present in some\\ndegree in every wakening of the mind to love, and every\\nopening of the eyes to beauty: no one is so poor as not to\\nhave felt their light and their liberation—even though it\\nbe true that “most forget.” “Love wakes men once a life-\\ntime each,” said Coventry Patmore ; and the fact of having\\nseen is indelible.\\n\\nTo hold to the meaning of this disclosure of the Real is\\nthe work of faith. And with that faith, and the reborn love\\nof life it brings, the will to create through suffering raises\\nits head. The world view of Christianity and its code, as we\\nhave said, are inseparable.\\n\\nFaith, natural and Christian; nature and swpernature.\\nAs the nucleus of a world view, the simple perception of\\nwhich we have been speaking seems far from the elaborate\\ntraditional outlook of the church. The early church\\nFathers seldom appealed to it in their formulations of the\\ncreed. In the original teaching of Jesus, however, it often\\ncame to evidence: he was keenly aware of the continuity\\nbetween the faith he repeatedly called for and the vital\\nfaith of the living creation. His frequent appeals to his\\nfollowers—“O, ye of little faith’—to “consider the\\nravens,” or even the lilies of the field, are calling attention\\nto this natural élan. And far more universally, the “daily\\nbread” of the Lord’s Prayer surely refers to sustainment\\nin the full gamut of its meaning—the totality of those\\nconditions, physical, social, cosmic, uncontrollable by our\\nown prudence, to which our action trusts as we throw our-\\nselves forward upon an invisible future. There will be\\n102 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nharvest, the stars and the seasons, and human nature about\\nus, and the quest of the unknown, and out of the unknown\\n—succor. If Santayana chooses to call this natural trust\\n“animal faith” his words are accurate—for the animals—\\nand valuable, as registering the continuity between ani-\\nmals and man, even in this matter of faith; but there is in\\nman no line at the animal level. Man’s vital faith has the\\ndistinctive character of all human mentality ; namely, that\\na sense of the whole is present in every part.** And for the\\n“average man,” perhaps for everyone, this sense of the\\nwhole is one of moyement-with-direction ; there is change\\neverywhere, but not aimless change. Given the intersubjec-\\ntive factor—always present, if our analysis of experience\\nis valid—the human whole sense will have the quality of\\npurposiveness, movement toward a goal—telos as we have\\ncalled it. The “animal faith” of man is thus the outgoing\\nof man’s life process toward a corresponding life process\\nin outer reality, which outgoing we might call the unceas-\\ning prayer of being alive as men.\\n\\nFaith is natural as breathing. I have referred to John\\nDewey’s appeal for a common faith in an objective source\\nand support of our “ideal ends,” for which objective sup-\\nport he was willing, under strict limitations, to use the\\nterm “God.” There are, he asserts, “natural forces and\\nconditions that promote” the unity of our ideal will-aims\\nand aid their realization. His emphasis is on the word\\n“natural”; his enemy, the “supernatural.” ** In my view\\nthe ground of faith is indeed natural—here I agree with\\nDewey and with Max Otto; ** and I insist with them on the\\ncontinuity between “natural piety” as piety toward nature\\n\\n*1 Preface to Philosophy, 16.\\n\\n22 Op. cit., 51,\\n33 See Appendix.\\nCHRISTIANITY! ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 103\\n\\nand whatever is honestly “mystical” in man’s spontaneous\\nreverence toward the world. But the opposition between\\nthe natural and the supernatural needs a second look.\\n\\nThe line between nature and supernature is a boundary\\nfor a specific purpose—that of science. And further, it is\\na natural boundary! The term “nature,” like the term\\n“self,” has, as we might put it, a double boundary: in the\\nnarrower sense it excludes its negative, the nonnatural or\\nthe nonself ; in the wider sense, each includes its negative.\\nIt is the human being, in the natural use of his reason, who\\ndefines what he means by “nature”—leaving himself, the\\ndefiner and purposer, out of the scope of the “nature” he\\ndefines, at the moment of that definition: he defines a realm\\nof natural necessity, of what used to be called “causes”;\\nbut he, the definer of that realm, is not caused by anything\\nin that realm to do the defining. He remains free and pur-\\nposive, while setting up his “closed group” of law-ruled\\nevents. In a strict sense, he in that act is “super’’-natural;\\nand all that is free, purposive, and creative in the universe\\nbelongs with him to a supernature, natural in the wider\\nsense. Thus faith, which is natural, is also faith in a super-\\nnatural.\\n\\nThis nuclear perception, the central tie of individual\\nman to his total environing world in its felt moral unity, is\\ncertainly not the whole of faith. But it is the germ from\\nwhich all wider faith grows. Given the responsive out-\\nreaching of the inescapable I-am toward the equally ines-\\ncapable (and naturally supernatural) Thou-art, animally\\ninstinctive if you or Santayana like, freedom and duty\\nbecome items of your faith; also the certitude that your\\npeace has its moral conditions in your use of that freedom\\n—the item of “sin” appears in your world sense whether or\\nnot the word enters your creed. And as the simplest faith\\n104 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nis the charter for action, and all action invades the future,\\nfaith must present a structural scheme of all futurity,\\nclaiming that futurity must provide a possibility of non-\\nfutility for human life; and hence that death itself, un-\\nquestionable encounter, must be a relative, not absolute,\\nconsummation of being in nothingness. For if the Some-\\nthing that I am has its conclusion and summation in Noth-\\ning, then faith is from the beginning a deceit. Natural\\nfaith extends to the relativity of death.**\\n\\nThe deep naturalness of Christianity grows on me as I\\nwrite, Even in respect to the “sense of sin” which has given\\nso many themes to theological punitive zeal and the fears\\nof the sick soul from St. Paul to Calvin and the Puritan\\nshores of America.\\n\\nTo much of the modern spirit, and indeed to the robust\\nself-confidence of normal humanity, Christianity has\\nseemed, and seems, unnaturally preoccupied with the ideas\\nof sin. And I would stand with the firm human sense of\\nright in the cosmos, ready to call God to account as well\\nas to be called to account: whoever and whatever is respon-\\nsible for my existence must respond to my just demand\\nthat existence-as-aspiring-being shall not be a condemna-\\ntion to futility. This postulate of right, as I have main-\\ntained for many years, even in the form of resentment\\nagainst apparent frustration, is one of the perennial\\nsources of the idea of God.” This clearly seen, we must\\nthen note that the idea of sin is not an arbitrary insertion\\ninto developing religion, but a necessary consequence of\\nman’s occupation with an absolute ideal—or, as we have\\n\\n24 A theme to which I shall return in the volume on Death and Life.\\n25 Meaning of God, 145 f. et passim.\\nCHRISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 105\\n\\nput the matter, with requirements of the impossible, such\\nas the call for perfection.\\n\\nThe sense of sin is, in the first instance, simply the\\nshadow of uncompromising standards. But whose stand-\\nards? We lose half of the fact if we impute them to the\\n“will of God,” and three-quarters of the fact if we fancy\\nthem as “Platonic Ideas” floating eternally in a tran-\\nscendent ether. They are demands which the soul of man is\\nbound to hold over itself. (For who could say, for example,\\n“T decline to accept the standard of perfection; my stand-\\nard is three-quarters of perfection”?) The situation is, as\\nReinhold Niebuhr so clearly recognizes, that the absolute\\nideal “grows up spontaneously in human nature.” *° Judg-\\nment by this ideal is inescapable, not because it is God’s\\njudgment, but because it is at the same time man’s own\\njudgment of himself. It is man’s glory that he can know\\nand apply this absolute standard: it is a part of his par-\\nticipation in God’s nature. It is the prerogative of man’s\\ntype of knowing—and we have seen modernity perplexed\\nby its own inability to resign this prerogative in presence\\nof its advance in subjectivity—the prerogative of know-\\ning the wniversal, which compels him to know his defect\\nas it is, and not as a flatterer would ease it. It is his mature\\nstrength that he can justly and unflinchingly estimate his\\nown weakness.\\n\\nHence Vivekananda was mistaken when he said, “It is a\\nsin to call men sinners.” He was right when he said that\\nmen are offshoots of God: it is precisely because of the\\nGod-nature within them that they—not we others—call\\nthemselves sinners. It is an artist’s suffering that he cannot\\nbring to his canvas the eternal meaning in what his eyes\\n\\n%¢ The Self and the Dramas of History, 141.\\n106 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nare fixed upon. But he would be the last to propose either\\nthat that beauty should be defaced to meet his powers, or\\nthat he himself should be deprived of the tormenting joy\\nof absorbing-through-presence what so far eludes his\\nrasp.\\n\\n. Ttis through its dwelling on sin that Christianity for\\nthe first time does full honor to human nature.*\" It does\\nnot dwell thereon in despair!\\n\\nChristianity as deed: essence requires existence. The\\nnatural faith in what is beyond me is essentially a faith in\\nkinship; man’s trust in the real, as soul of the whole, is\\ntrust in the connaturalness of being, both as source of sup-\\nport and as source of demand. Religion has always inclined\\nto represent this kinship in the guise of pananimism:\\nChristianity represents it in the guise of the Fatherhood of\\nGod, perceived in experience.\\n\\nAs personal experience, crucial item of autobiography,\\nsuch a perception-born faith might remain a private\\nillumination and nothing more. But if private experience\\n\\n®7 Hence, while accepting the principle of Omar Khayydm’s bold re~\\nversal of court: “For all the sin wherewith the face of man is blackened,\\nman’s forgiveness give—and take”! we must suspect the thoroughgoing\\nself-absolution thus invited. There is, however, one touch of sin which I\\nregard as a merit, and for whose acceptance I would invoke neither\\nOmar nor yet Reinhold Niebuhr, but rather the conscience of the artist\\nwho, at some point, must call his work done! He knows Its Imperfection;\\nyet he knows, too, that he cannot forever rectify. The price of his bear-\\ning any fruit is that he retains the capacity to reject the importunity of\\nthe absolute, which would reduce him to barrenness and despair. This\\n“calling done” what is not done—and the same is true of every work that\\nembodies an infinite goal, finishing a book, for example—contains an\\ningredient of sin, of presumption. Yet if in the work the worship of the\\nperfect has been genuine, the piece called done will witness beyond\\nitself to what was aimed at: and where this is true, perhaps the forgive-\\nness is conveyed together with the sin. I surmise that all fertility may\\ncontain this moral cost, and moral repair.\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 107\\n\\nis—as we may now assert with good conscience—experi-\\nence of the universal, it will press for transmission. In its\\nown nature, our most primitive human illumination is a\\nbreaking out of solitude into a possessed intersubjectivity,\\nwhich is also consubjectivity. Through the love born in it\\nas a response, the discovering and realizing self is under\\ninner pressure to spread its light.\\n\\nAnd its first task as faith-spreading will be a summons\\nto others to see—not as accepting general propositions\\nabout the cosmos, though the time for such truths will\\ncome, but as seeing. And presumably as seeing in the same\\nhuman context in which the soul was first awakened. For\\nthe lover, bound to convey universal truth to its rightful\\nreceivers, can hardly fail to dilate on the merits of the par-\\nticular other in whom he has caught his vision of the\\nAbsolute. That other, for him, is “the Way.”\\n\\nThus the meaning of individual experience tends to un-\\nfold in a continuing community of witness bearers, at once\\na product of individual rebirth and a source of further re-\\nbirths. Through its self-propagating impulse, the inherent\\nuniversality of its perception will tend to make itself\\nactual in the structure of history (The Meaning of God,\\nch. xxxu1). The prophetic deed of the original Teacher,\\nhis self-commitment to a course involving his death as\\na factor in laying the foundations of “a Kingdom of\\nRighteousness,” thus becomes not merely an item of his-\\ntory long left behind, but a moving front contemporary\\nto all subsequent times. Religion can call for no faith in\\nwhat was, except as a faith in what is.*®\\n\\n28 Cf. Kierkegaard: “There is no disciple at second hand. ... For\\nwhoever has what he has from God himself clearly has it at first hand;\\nand he who does not have it from God himself is not a disciple.”\\nPhilosophical Fragments, 88, 84.\\n108 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nNow the prophecy of the prophet, that from his own\\ndeed and sacrifice will proceed an always contemporary\\nand ultimately universal persuasive force actualizing in\\nhuman history a reign of truth—this prophecy may con-\\nceivably fail. But the truth it embodies, the essence of the\\nChristian world view, that God loves the world—this world\\n—and works there to bring it to himself, asserts a will that\\ncannot fail. For God cannot fail. This truth, then, is not\\nvalid as pure truth: it is not valid unless it makes itself\\ngood. For the Christian to give the world up as lost is to\\ngive God up, and to reject the validity of his vision.\\n\\nIt belongs therefore to the essence of Christianity that\\nits world view is being actualized in history. It may be a\\nmisuse of language to say that for Christianity existence\\nis an essence; but it is accurate to say that it is essential\\nfor Christianity that its essence ewist.\\n\\nWe thus complete our answer to the question as to what\\nChristianity is. Its essence is threefold, creed, code, and\\ndeed—a code and a deed, rooted in a faith, which in turn\\nsprings from a personal experience, a perception of the\\nnature of things.\\n\\nThe faith: That the nature of things is divine love for\\nthe created world, a love that suffers;\\n\\nThe code: That desire must be reborn as active love, a\\nwill to create through suffering;\\n\\nThe deed: The movement initiated by such a will, as\\ncreating the conditions for the nonfutility of all such wills.\\nThus the kingdom is being actualized, a slow leaven in\\nhuman history, or in another figure, a war of persuasion in\\na world of free wills.\\nCHRISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 109\\n\\ny.

And whether in spite\\nof their defiance of possibility and probability, or because\\nof it, they move toward world validation.\\n\\nThe Prophet of Nazareth was indeed careful to declare\\nhis teaching as the fulfillment of the Jewish Law: his in-\\nductions were the essence of that specific tradition, and\\nof no other—they might well remain qualified by that fact.\\nBut it was his offense in the eyes of his own religious\\nauthorities that his teaching broke away from its own\\nlocal orthodoxy. The questions his inductions answered\\nwere indeed the questionings of thoughtful Jews, but they\\nwere also the questionings of the Empire and of mankind.\\nOn this account, his answers could spread as they did, “to\\nthe Jew first, and also to the Gentile.”\\n\\nIt lies in the nature of all induction that it shakes off\\nthe limitations of its actual collection of data.

In the field of morals, such an induction, rebuk-\\ning natural impulse as a deeper nature in oneself rebukes\\nit, would touch the minds of hearers with an appeal pro-\\nportionate to its radical demand—perhaps with an odd\\nsense of Platonic reminiscence, as of a haunting considera-\\ntion long familiar to the subconscious self. Its discovery\\nand formulation would be dated events, but they would\\nappear as dated releases of the eternal *°—and while sub-\\nject to restatement, would enter the store of the “unlos-\\nables.”\\n\\nThe Christian essences of precept belong to this store.\\nAnnounced authoritatively and unargued, they either\\nconvince without argument or are dismissed as preposter-\\nous.

Because\\nof this, it is easy to adopt the non sequitur that no truth\\nis permanent. One might as well say that because each\\naddition to the family alters the parents, the parental\\nidentity is lost. It is precisely because of this constant\\nreassembling that the factors of permanence become\\nsalient as structural elements of the growing totality, ele-\\nments whose identity marks the identity of the whole.\\n\\nChristian teaching in its origin asserted finality, but in\\na language that purposely left room for growth. Much of\\nit wore a deliberately cryptic manner, as only for those\\nwho, “having ears to hear,” possessed the key. The inten-\\ntional nonliterality of many sayings—their practical ab-\\nsurdity if literally taken—was an effective way of putting\\nfirst things first: “Therefore take no thought, saying,\\nWhat shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Where-\\nwithal shall we be clothed? . . . But seek ye first the\\nkingdom of God.” And if the Teacher was right in his\\nidentification of the first things, no amount of reordering\\namong the secondary things can disturb this status: what\\nwas thus placed first remains first.\\n\\nTwo thousand years have seen immense shifts in the\\nfurniture of the good life and also of the right life. They\\nhave opened questions in politics and economics, and in the\\npicture of social evolution, that lay far beyond the horizon\\nof that time. The normal roles of the primary instincts,\\nincluding pugnacity, sex love, and acquisition, the im-\\nportance of responsible self-care, ambition, foresight,\\nenterprise, competition—mastery of nature, accumulation\\nof knowledge—have become recognized elements of moral-\\nity. The early Christian contemptus mundi, suiting itself\\nperhaps instinctively in a crumbling empire to a conserv-\\n112 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ning role of cultural reversion-to-the-chrysalis, over-\\nweighted its message on the world-rejecting side.

The essences of precept\\nwe have considered stand as true universals, independent\\nof their historical origins. They convince as ideals even\\nwhen the rankling problem of practical validity remains\\nunsolved for lack of the presupposed world view.\\n\\nWorld view, theology, and revelation. Now if the valid-\\nity of the Christian essence of precept depends on the\\nvalidity of the Christian world view, our intuitive assent\\nto the spirit of the precepts carries with it a presumption\\nof the validity of its premiss—the appeal of the ethic lends\\nsupport to the metaphysic. But the cases are somewhat\\ndifferent: the world view as the crucial factor requires\\nseparate consideration.\\n\\nSince the substance of the Christian faith is given in a\\nperception available to “any man” in his own context and\\ntime, an element of universality is, as we observed, built\\ninto its nature. But it is a contingent universality —“If\\nany man hear my voice, and will open the door. . . .” This\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 113\\n\\nappears at first to put the Christian world view on a par\\nwith the universality of empirical science, whose findings\\nare in principle verifiable by all observers. But it is on a\\ndifferent footing in two respects. First, its truth cannot be\\nconfirmed by all observers, because it cannot be confirmed\\nby any “observer”: the conditions for confirming are not\\ndispassionate, they are moral and personal.** And at the\\nsame time, it cannot be received as scientific truth has for\\nthe most part to be received, solely on authority, i.c., as a\\nvalid generality established by the experiment of author-\\nized others. Rather, it must be received by each one\\nthrough his own experience. The Christian world view is\\nwilling to achieve actual universality only through the\\nabsolute particularity of its address, to each one severally.\\nThis is its point of honor.\\n\\nBecause of this personal condition, it might be inferred\\nthat there will always be a line of division in the world\\nbetween those who see and those who do not see. What to\\nsome is universal truth, will to the others be universal\\nfalsehood, based on wishful thinking. In a sense, this divi-\\nsion is the actual situation. But if I am right, the faith of\\nthe Christian is continuous with the nature faith by which\\nall men live—the light that, at least dimly, “lighteth every\\nman that cometh into the world.” It is the making-fully-\\nexplicit of this universal faith. It is therefore present in\\nsome degree wherever religion is present. And religion is\\nso far natural that its basic faith—always coexisting with\\nthe natural obstacles to faith—can be excluded only by a\\ndefinite act of rejection, as by force of an inconsistent\\ntheory—a night view, perhaps—held with conscientious\\n\\n%1 Pure objectivity, as keeping one’s self out of the picture, destroys\\n\\nthe basis of the experience. This is largely the theme of Gabriel Marcel’s\\npenetrating Jowrnal Métaphysique.\\n114 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nresolution, waiting theoretical release. Christianity must\\nacquire in its equipment theoretical answers to acquired\\ntheoretical embolisms of this sort. In substance, it has only\\nto remove obstacles, not to insert an alien content, since, as\\nTertullian saw, “the human mind is naturally Christian.”\\nIt may speak everywhere for its own essence-of-faith with\\nconfidence in its universality, as essence.\\n\\nI say “as essence” because all theology outpasses the\\nessence. Through a rightful alliance with imagination and\\nart, and the just tendency of piety to multiply its objects\\nof reverence, Christian theology like all others has ad-\\nmitted accumulations of detail tending to smother the\\nstark simplicities of legitimate certitude. It has in times\\npast developed a highly organized and pictorially specific\\nother world, increasingly revolting to our intuition of the\\ndignity of the ultimate mysteries of being. So far as this\\ntype of development is cherished and embedded in the\\ncorpus of required faith, universality is necessarily im-\\npeded. Nothing can be universal that offends this intui-\\ntion, though the capacity of mankind, in presence of an\\nindubitable jewel, to ignore its mounting is immense. This\\naccumulation, therefore, has been and continues to be an\\nobject of reconception. The cause of universality does not\\ndemand that faith reduce itself to the bare minimum of\\nnatural piety; but it does demand that the area of dog-\\nmatic affirmation approach the simplicity of the essence,\\nretaining the treasures of imaginative expression in the\\nform of poetry, allegory, and symbol.\\n\\nNote on revelation, reason, and repentance:\\n\\nTheology has tended to protect the content of this accumula-\\ntion by way of the concept of revelation—“Here God has\\nspoken” ; and the province of truth thus revealed has been held\\nCHRISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 115\\n\\nto be precisely that which human experience and reason can-\\nnot reach.\\n\\nIf this line between provinces is absolute, dogma stands\\nforever beyond critical judgment. But if truth is to be a unity\\n—as it must be if human nature is to keep its own unity—the\\ncontents of revealed truth must have certification for our own\\nminds: they must find place within the frame of what we con-\\ntinuously apprehend as “the whole.” Any critique of pure\\nreason must give good reasons for what lies beyond reason.\\nIf revelation is to be apprehended by faith, is faith, then, to be\\nset in contrast with reason?\\n\\nIn speaking earlier of the basis of faith (above, p. 101), I\\nhave used the term “mystic experience,” a term which like\\nBergson’s “intuition” runs the risk of suggesting an esoteric\\nor nonconceptual type of knowledge. I was careful to note that\\nso far from being unnatural, “it is a passing from the un-\\nnatural to the natural and true.” It is a wakening; and as such\\nit may be abrupt and momentarily daze-begetting. One who\\nhaving been on the wrong track suddenly regains his bearings\\nis likely to be at first confused by the afterimage of his illusory\\nsense of direction: his recovery may appear as an incursion\\nfrom outside, perhaps as Saul-who-became-Paul was halted on\\nthe way to Damascus. But the vindication of his new percep-\\ntion is that it clearly recognizes the error: it takes the measure\\nof both truth and falsehood, as if to say “Now for the first\\ntime I see things as they really are; hitherto, I have been\\nblind.” The appeal of the revelation is to one’s own judgment\\n—quite the reverse of setting that judgment aside by force\\nmajeure.\\n\\nIn the new light, the previous blindness is of course repudi-\\nated; and if that blindness is felt to be in some sense culpable,\\nthis repudiation is ipso facto a repentance. Faith in the new\\nbrings with it repentance of the old. Reinhold Niebuhr inclines,\\nif I read him aright, to regard repentance a precondition of\\nfaith: he speaks (e.g. in Faith and History, 189) of “the re-\\npentance which is the presupposition of renewal of life.” I\\nsuggest that the course of experience follows the reverse order:\\nappealing from Niebuhr to Niebuhr, repentance is possible\\nonly when one sees that he was wrong, ie., as the light dawns\\n116 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\non him (ibid. 140, at bottom). Thus it is with the revelation\\ninvolved in all love: now one sees; and as for one’s previous\\ncondition which appeared to itself so rational, “Atheists are as\\ndull who cannot guess God’s presence out of sight””—the poct’s\\nanalogy is exact. Repentance of that dullness is a consequence\\nof the illumination: repentance is a consequence of faith\\n(which is perception), not a precondition.\\n\\nGiven this change of order, it is no longer necessary to con-\\nsider faith as something that supervenes upon the bankruptcy\\nof human reason, or its entanglement in dilemmas with no\\napparent rational escape, in any other sense than that in which\\nall empirical data come to us, as something given, not cal-\\nculated in advance, Our great solutions arrive empirically; but\\nthey are none the less solutions. Revelation is empiricism on\\nthe spiritual level. It has the chafacter of a solution, a fully\\nrational character, not devised, but found. Faith is its recogni-\\ntion.\\n\\nThe deed and its history: problem of positive religion.\\nBut the essence of Christianity, if we are right, is not ex-\\nhausted in precept and world view together. There is still\\nthe deed, and its history, A positive religion, which we\\nhave likened to a system of positive law, is a body of\\nthought-and-precept entangled with a body of experience.\\nThat experience, personal and corporate, its history, be-\\ncomes so far part of the being of a positive law system that\\nsuch systems in Europe have not been interchangeable nor\\ntransferable from nation to nation in spite of a large com-\\nmon content of universal principle. Our chief problem lies\\nhere. Do the historical aspects of Christianity—which\\nafter all make up its personal identity—do they detract\\nfrom or perhaps contradict the universality of the whole\\nas a concrete movement?\\n\\nPut the question the other way around. Is the religion\\nof the world civilization to be “a” religion, or simply\\nreligion? Must it shed the particulars of founders, sacred\\nCHRISTIANITY ! ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 117\\n\\nbooks, acts of the apostles, councils, creeds, churches, sac-\\nraments, lives of the saints, commentaries and commen-\\ntaries on commentaries? This is a plea that recurs; and to\\nit John Dewey has given powerful support, voicing the\\ntemper of many a modern spirit long disaffected from con-\\ntending details of organized religion, yet equally discon-\\ntent with a religionless secularism. Dewey regards “A\\nCommon Faith” as a matter of urgency; but to reach it,\\nhe would “wipe the slate clean and start afresh . . . free\\nfrom all historic encumbrances.” **\\n\\nThis is not peculiarly a modern plea, In some degree it\\nhas characterized all the great reformers and founders,\\nincluding Jesus of Nazareth. Is it perhaps an irony of\\nhistory that each of the great universal religions, having\\ndismissed one group of particulars, has taken on another;\\nfor each of them, having well distanced the localism of its\\nbackground, has attached itself with even greater em-\\nphasis to the particular person of its founder. Is this, I\\nask, a bit of irony dogging every leap toward the universal,\\nor is it an indirect evidence that religion, in its freest form,\\nis not fully itself without identification as a continuing\\nhistoric enterprise?\\n\\nIf this is true of any religion, it is true of Christianity\\nwith peculiar emphasis. For Christianity is explicitly the\\nreligion of “the prophetic consciousness”—that is to say\\nof the affirmative relationship of faith to historic effect.™\\nTo Jesus, faith ought to be a power; and if it was not,\\nthere was something wrong with the faith. His was the\\noriginal “satyagraha,” spirit in control of fact, calling for\\npower over events as a duty, and as an achievement if one\\nhave faith “as a grain of mustard seed.” Less than any\\n\\n32.4 Common Faith, 6, 8-11.\\n83 Meaning of God, 518-24,\\n118 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nother religion, less than Buddhism or Islam, certainly\\nless than Hinduism, for the religion of Gandhi was half\\nChristian, can Christianity abstract its essential truth\\nfrom its historic being, the deed of its prophet, and the\\ndoer.\\n\\nIts particularity, however, is by no means limited to its\\npersonal identification with the work and prophecy of its\\nfounder; apart from this, it continues to carry a heavy\\nload of historical detail.\\n\\nTis sacred books bear traces of its struggle with Greek\\nand Roman philosophies, and more than traces of its\\nPalestinian ancestry. It records, to be sure, its own breach\\nwith the older teaching, and with the proprietary spirit of\\nHebrew chosenness: if “God is able of these stones to raise\\nup children unto Abraham” the exclusive picture of linear\\ninheritance falls to the ground. But for this very reason,\\nthe New Testament requires the Old Testament including\\nall the Hebrew history for its intelligibility. Christianity\\nwas indeed a new beginning, and as a conscious effort to\\nsubordinate all subsequent history to a universal idea, the\\nkingdom of God, its arrival marks a division point in the\\nflow of time. But it is a history-bound effort thus to sub-\\nordinate history—otherwise it could mark no division\\npoint!\\n\\nWhat we here encounter is the irrational element in all\\nexperience. The price of existence, of all decision and\\naction, is partnership with the irrational ; if an idea is to be\\nmore than idea, it must carry the accidents of time, place,\\nevent context—factuality as it is found, nondeducible.\\nTo “realize” an idea is to equip it with a here-and-now;\\nand every here-and-now has its irrelevant limitation. In\\nChristianity’s early struggle for existence the irrational\\nelement becomes a conscious issue: “to the Jews a stum-\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE note 119\\n\\nbling block and to the Greeks foolishness.” ** As a phil-\\nosophic teaching, it might have separated itself from these\\naccidents. As a task, it could not do so, for its task was to\\nmake just these irrationals subserve the will of God—this\\nis “incarnation.”\\n\\nInstead of shaking free from its particulars, Christian-\\nity accordingly inclines to preserve them as if they were\\nprecious elements of its universal gospel: it celebrates its\\nown birthday; ritualizes the passion of its prophet; in-\\nclines to condense its message to mankind into two words,\\nFollow Christ. As a movement it thus claims a personality\\nof its own, as distinct, as odd, as steeped in peculiar,\\nirrational circumstance as any individual personality.\\n\\nIs its universality thereby compromised?\\n\\nHow can it fail to be?\\n\\nPerhaps the best preliminary answer would be a par-\\nticular answer, with the simple premiss that the “irra-\\ntional”—strange to say—is what everybody understands:\\nas empirical knowers, what we are most used to is the\\ngivenness of the given. Since all particulars are in a sense\\nirrational, it would be irrational to expect existence with-\\nout irrationality. The reception by any person—himself a\\nreason wrapped in irrationals—of any new being, person,\\nreligion, will be governed by this understanding—not\\nignoring accidents of history and personality, but wn-\\nhindered by them.\\n\\nLet me illustrate by an instance from the Orient, where\\nChristianity has been and continues to be under fire as\\nexotic. I quote from a book by Yasaki Takagi published\\nin Japan in 1954:\\n\\n34 Cf. A. A. Bowman’s remarkable essay, The Absurdity of Christian-\\nity, 1931.\\n120 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThe fundamental weakness of the Meiji, that is, the modern\\nJapanese civilization, was the mistaken notion that the various\\naspects of Western civilization—political, economic, and social\\n—could be borrowed without adopting its spiritual foundation,\\nand the failure to grasp the basic idea of individuality, which\\nis to be traced essentially to Christianity. .. .\\n\\nMy personal conviction is that the Japanese are thus at a\\nmomentous juncture of their history, confronting the grave\\nquestion whether they decide to engraft their own civilization\\ninto the tree of Western Civilization based on the Christian\\nconcept of human personality, which is after all, the major\\ntrank of universal human civilization. This, it seems to me, is\\nthe only way to save our nation. . . 5\\n\\nThere is here a remarkably clear conception of civiliza-\\ntion itself as an entity with an individual history, having\\nall the extraneous attributes and the limitations of a grop-\\ning and finite organism, and yet carrying universality in\\nits arms.*° What Dr. Takagi singles out of western civi-\\nlization as needed by Japan is an “idea”—clearly a uni-\\nversal—“the basic idea of individuality . . . the Chris-\\ntian concept of human personality”: why does he not\\nsuggest taking it as an idea, instead of as the sap of a\\nconcretely growing tree? Is it perhaps because rootage of\\nan idea in the actual problems and confusions of strug-\\n\\n%° Toward International Understanding, 186 f.\\n\\n3° Professor Takagi’s outlook, with its superiority to the afterklang\\nof recent political passions, is not exceptional in his land. A slight inci-\\ndent may extend the picture. In April, 1955, I was inquiring of a Japa-\\nnese in Washington about the present inclination of Japanese young\\npeople in religion. He reported that Buddhism and Shinto were declining\\nin influence whereas Christianity was gaining: I was prepared for the\\nfirst statement, but not for the second. I asked, “Do they then favor the\\nreligion of the recent enemy?” “No,” was the answer; “They favor\\nChristianity. But not as the religion of the enemy, As universal religion.”\\nThe discernment of this answer is the more significant since it involves\\nno repudiation of the historical per ee. A recent writer, Dean Aikawa of\\nKanto Gakuin, Yokahama, puts the case even more sharply: “Young\\nJapanese do not want to be loyal to the West any more; they want to be\\nloyal to Christ.” (Christian Contury, Oct. 12, 1955.)\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 121\\n\\ngling mankind, beside being a pledge of literal good faith,\\nis part of the meaning of the idea?\\n\\nIf this is a fair clue to our dilemma, it may even be the\\ncase that the personality of a religion, as “steeped in irra-\\ntional cirecumstance”—so far from compromising its uni-\\nversality—would contribute to its definition. Let us\\nexplore this clue.\\n\\nWe need take no issue with Plato as to whether every\\nenfleshment of an idea involves some defacement of its per-\\nfect essence: we assume this probability. But I point out,\\nas against both Plato and Kant, that existence, in the case\\nof an idea of right living, is an element of perfection. For\\nright living has to be realized in a limitless variety of cir-\\ncumstances, each one of which adds to the meaning of the\\nload which “right living” has to carry: the experience of\\ntrying to carry out a precept is at the same time a thinking\\nprocess reaching a judgment as to what that precept\\nmeans. Any injunction to right feeling or action implies\\nimpediments thereto; the gift of free human creativity\\nimplies ever-new inventiveness, including inventiveness in\\nways of going wrong; the burden of the injunction, to be\\ncompletely understood, will require a course of experience\\n—let us say as long as the inventiveness of evil continues!\\nEven as addressed to the single individual, whose exigency\\nis always particular and unique, the meaning comes in full\\nonly with the embodiment in deed. The more comprehen-\\nsive the induction of a precept, and the more unqualified\\nits claim of finality through all time, the more indispensable\\nis the wide-flung and long-lasting experience of applying\\nit—it must have historic existence.\\n\\nThis requirement rests with peculiar emphasis on the\\ncommand to love God and neighbor. Its summons is too\\n122 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\neasily spoken and accepted unless its meaning is charged\\nwith an infinite realism. Without a literal and continued\\nencounter with circumstance, “love” is a generality unfit\\nto carry the burden of religious faith in the age we now\\nenter, forced as this age is to take the full measure of pos-\\nsible tragedy and also of the burgeoning potential cruelty\\nof man’s action on man. God’s love to man must mean love\\non the part of a being coinvolved in the ewistence of this\\nworld, such as it is. To speak responsibly of this love, and\\nof man’s answering affirmation, religion must continually\\nexplore the expanding sense of its own finalities—it must\\nbe “a” religion, having its own experience.*”\\n\\nThe assumption of my argument is that religion, and\\nespecially the Christian religion, is committed to the thesis\\nthat the will of God is to be done in this world.\\n\\nThere is indeed a sense in which all religion is a flight\\nfrom the City of Destruction. The Christian’s citizenship\\nis explicitly elsewhere (a trait which led Rousseau to ex-\\nclude him from membership in his ideal city-state) ; and\\nthe glory of his new life is that he “has overcome the\\nworld.” Still, if he can achieve this overcoming, and reach\\na love of God or of life, only by an act of moral alienation\\nfrom the grim detail of earthly affairs (as Berdyaev seems\\nto propose), he has lost the secret of the vitality of this\\nparticular religion. For its vitality lies in the paradox\\n\\n57 It is just in this relation of experience to meaning—a position which\\nI would a priori assume that a good pragmatist would favor—that John\\nDewey finds reason for secking the jettison of specific historic religion,\\nevery “a” religion, whereas to me it calls for the concrete and explorative\\nwork of an identifiable religious community. The difficulty, of course, is\\nin Dewey\\'s objection to finality in any form, especially the finality of\\nreligious dogma, whereas In my view finality somewhere is the necessary\\n\\ncondition of any intelligent experimentation. In the general necessity of\\nexperience to meaning, Dewey and I are in full accord.\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 123\\n\\nwhereby detachment is a condition of more effective re-\\nattachment, an alternation well understood by the greater\\nmystics, in which lies the germ of historical creativity, and\\nits perpetual renewal.**\\n\\nWe cannot begin to understand the career of Christian-\\nity apart from its magnificent and radical ingredient of\\ncontemptus mundi, far more passion-filled than the Stoic’s\\nproud freedom-from-perturbation or the Buddhist’s delib-\\nerate discipline of desire—and no doubt capable of fanati-\\ncal excess.** But neither can it be understood without its\\nequally magnificent adoption of this world and its history\\nas locus of a cosmic drama, never to be abandoned to\\ndespair.\\n\\nIt is tempting to see religion in terms of but one phase\\nof this strife of opposites. In a luminous essay, a recent\\ncommentator on The Messianic Idea in Israel points out\\nthat Judaism would never have affirmed that the kingdom\\nof the Messiah “is not of this world.” *° For the Messianic\\nidea, he holds, includes a definite political hope. And the\\nJewish Messiah is “a human being, flesh and blood, like all\\nmortals.” His kingdom is, in brief, a step toward the con-\\nsummation of the meaning of human history, here and now.\\n\\nThis view is not in complete contrast with that of Chris-\\ntianity, nor of its founder. The man who (in the narrative,\\nJohn 18) stood accused of calling himself a king, pleaded\\nnot guilty in one sense, but accepted the indictment in an-\\nother. He declined to consider himself “king of the Jews”;\\nhe acknowledged headship of a kingdom of “truth.” What\\nhe was repudiating in the words “not of this world” was\\n\\n98 Meaning of God, ch.

In general terms, the struggle of the Son of Man\\nwith the adversities of his own life and his acceptance of\\ndeath are indeed typical of the human problem of faith in\\nall places and times; they need no supplement to symbolize\\nwith complete literalness the fundamental precept of losing\\none’s life in order to save it. He doubtless regarded his\\ncourse toward death as so expressly an evidence and token\\nof his own conviction—the first human will-to-death on\\nprecisely that issue, an issue which he himself had publicly\\ncreated—that no one thereafter, on that issue, could ever\\nbe as he was—alone. As his followers would be confronted\\nby this same call to sacrifice, he would as pathbreaker be\\nwith them, “even to the end of the world.” And yet it was\\npart of his prospect to anticipate developments in their\\nexperience for which further light would be needed: they\\nwould wish to be “led into all truth.” In their encounter\\nwith emergencies whose shape only the endless devising of\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 125\\n\\nthe future would reveal, there would be the continuing dis-\\nclosure of the purport of the unchanging identity of faith.\\nOnly an enduring historic continuity could fully reveal\\nits meaning.\\n\\nSignificance of irrational; inescapable tension. We may\\nnow fairly affirm, in answer to the question raised above,\\nthat the history of a particular faith normally contributes\\nto its definition; and that in so far as it does so, the uni-\\nversality of that faith is not compromised.\\n\\nBut it would be an error to infer from this that there is\\nno tension between its historical development and its uni-\\nversal essence. We have two propositions to bear in mind.\\nFirst, that a religion pertinent to human life, in order to\\nbe universal, must be particular—it must be a “concrete\\nuniversal.” Second, the particular aspects of such a his-\\ntorical movement are in constant tension with its universal\\ncharacter. This would be true were it only for the here-\\nand-now limitation of a gospel emerging in human history,\\nwhich seems from the outset to violate the necessary limit-\\nless reach of a Word of eternal import to all men.\\n\\nThis tension is perpetually renewed. The tendency\\ntoward enriching the content of faith, as experience reveals\\nits implications, has to be constantly challenged by the\\ndemand for simplicity and identity with the original teach-\\ning. And the very process of self-discovery, applying the\\ngeneralities of the precepts to changing conditions of life,\\nthe necessity of working in the given world in terms of\\ncurrent pressures, techniques, concepts—not to say with\\nworldly methods—must come into clash with the demand\\nfor the original purity and unworldliness.\\n\\nThis clash was prompt to appear in Christian history.\\nWe find it full-fledged in the second century, as in the\\n126 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ncareer of that stormy genius Tertullian, who after years\\nof contest with churchly officialdom rejected his ardently\\nespoused Catholicism for the crudely primitive and austere\\nsect of Montanists. He felt a need to be near what had\\noriginally impelled him, a Roman, to the new cult—pre-\\nsumably the inner greatness of martyrs who “had some-\\nthing” which he and other well-placed worldlings had not.\\n\\nTertullian’s unfinished struggle is still unfinished. It is\\npertinent to observe, in passing, that the mixture of the\\nChristian essences with historical amalgam did certainly\\nnot prevent the spread of the faith in those early days. The\\nbroad historical fact that Christianity has been migratory\\nindicates not only that its essences are not restricted in\\ntheir appeal to special varieties of human nature, but also\\nthat its particulars have at least not fatally impeded their\\nrecognition—leaving open the possibility that they have\\nhelped it. It is true that these migrations have not been\\nunattended by schism, attributable to some extent to this\\nlocal variety: that Roman and Byzantine versions have\\npulled apart; that Nestorian Christianity, advancing\\nthrough Asia even into China, went an independent way;\\nthat Coptic and Armenian Christianities, the ancient\\nChristianity of southwest India, and various other semi-\\ninsulated Christian plantings, developed individual tenets\\nand practices.*t But it is also true, I believe, that while\\nthese variations have made their nests in the particular\\nand pictorial phases of the faith, none of the variants has\\ndeparted from what we have called the essence in its three-\\nfold simplicity.\\n\\n*1 Some of these deviations have been sufficiently wide to inspire the\\nphenomenon of Christian missions to Christians—a matter which first\\ncame to my attention through the circumstance that a maternal aunt was\\n\\nfor many years stationed at Mardin, Turkey, as missioner to Armenian\\nChristians,\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE noLe 127\\n\\nIn this complex and diversified history, we are justified\\nin limiting our attention for the moment to the European\\narea, because it is in Europe that the Christian ethic and\\nworld view took firmest and for a time almost exclusive\\nroot, and it is also here that they have been subject to the\\nmost radical strains, It is these strains that are of decisive\\nmoment in judging the availability of Christianity for the\\ncoming civilization. Our present question then takes this\\nform, whether the particularities of Christian history in\\nEurope have beclouded its universality, or released it.\\n\\nIn this its western pilgrimage we may trace two broad\\nphases—first from an original simplicity toward com-\\nplexity, through extraordinary cultural creativity, with\\nnatural incidents of worldly entanglement and efflores-\\ncence of supernatural adornment; and then a reverse\\nphase toward greater reticence, approaching simple iden-\\ntity with its essence. During its earlier periods, Christian-\\nity was applying itself with incredible energy, replacing a\\ncrumbling political order, molding institutions and arts\\nto patterns it regarded as dictated by its world vision and\\nethos. Whatever our judgment of the result, the magni-\\ntude of this achievement constitutes a unique chapter in\\nhuman history whose measure we are barely beginning to\\nassess.!*\\n\\nIn so doing it took the local coloring of the medium in\\nwhich it was working: it was in making “the West” that\\nChristianity became “western.” Then, as we have seen,** it\\n\\n42 Beside several notable recent studies on the general topic of\\nChristianity and Civilization, and Toynbee’s monumental work, mono-\\ngraphs on special aspects of cultural history have broken new ground,\\nas in Roscoe Pound\\'s notable lectures on religion and law.

This\\nself-emptying inaugurated a new stage of self-discovery:\\nprofiting by the free criticism of these its now secularized\\noffspring, it has been learning to identify itself with some-\\nthing less than Christendom as a whole. With what, then?\\nHas it shed its entire weight of cultural concreteness to\\nreturn to its original emptiness—the simple germinal es-\\nsences inherently universal? If not, what is the goal toward\\nwhich this process points?\\n\\nDouble relationship to western institutions. Patently\\nthe recent period, in which arts and institutions have gone\\nlargely their own way, is one in which Christianity can no\\nlonger accept responsibility for, still less identity with, the\\nresulting pattern of culture. It identifies itself today with\\nno institution (other than the ideal and unified church)\\nand with no set of institutions. Yet it holds itself pertinent\\nto all of them; it maintains the permanent attitude of re-\\nsponsible criticism. It is not, and never can be, an ideology,\\nspecifying a program for world order with an economic\\nand political as well as moral goal; yet there is not a corner\\nof human life toward which it admits itself irrelevant.\\n\\nWith the disappearance of a Christendom which could\\npresent itself as a model of applied Christianity, there has\\nemerged a double relationship to the institutional western\\nworld which we must define with some care. There is a rela-\\ntion of freedom and a relation of involvement. There is\\nfreedom from control and from carrying the sole burden of\\ncreative and re-creative work. Christianity today is pre-\\npared to recognize its own germinal function in the spirit\\nof human relationships, rather than in their overt shapes,\\nnone of which shapes can be declared deducible from the\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 129\\n\\nspirit of love to God and neighbor. It would be false to say\\nthat Christianity is or has a “social gospel” in the sense\\nthat there is a specific form of property, polity, family,\\neducation, et cetera, deducible from the spirit of love. It\\nwould be equally false to say that there is no social gospel;\\nthere is a definite relation of involvement.\\n\\nLet me illustrate. Christianity is certainly committed to\\n“charity,” whether in the broad meaning of agape or in\\nthe special meaning of aid to the needy. But whether this\\ncharity is to express itself in alms, or in aid to self-help\\nwith conserved self-respect, or in a frontal attack upon\\npoverty itself, be it by general social reform or by eco-\\nnomic revolution, deponent sayeth not. Christianity dic-\\ntates no policy and joins no party ; ** yet it is applicable\\n(sporadically or systematically) at any existing level of\\nsocial intelligence. It assumes, probably rightly, that there\\nwill always be scope for charity: that the time will never\\ncome when one man can say to another, “I have no need to\\nwhich you can minister,” and when therefore the great\\nsaying “Inasmuch as ye have done it . . .” could have no\\napplication.\\n\\nThe fallacy of identifying any given form of property\\nlaw with Christianity has become a commonplace. But to\\ninfer from this that Christianity is indifferent to the func-\\ntions of institutions would be an even graver fallacy. Insti-\\ntutions as they stand are structures of a positive law whose\\ndraperies are circumstantial, but whose backbone seeks\\n\\n44 This has been well put by Gabriel Marcel in his recent book, The\\nDecline of Wisdom: “The essential aim of knowledge and life is the\\nordering of oneself to the cosmos, rather than exercising a transforming\\naction on a world which man might be regarded as having to subject to\\nhis desires or needs.” This is wholly consistent with the aim of exercising\\na transforming action on human wills, and thus on human history, with\\nconsequent alleviation of misery—an essential phase, I take it, of the\\npromotion of the kingdom of God in this present world.\\n130 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nabsolute stability. If it can be maintained that the dignity\\nof man, his freedom, and his development, require some\\nform of property—yes, of private property as well as\\ncommon property ““—and if it is true that Christianity\\ndemands such freedom as an aspect of the soul’s dignity,\\nand has been the original protagonist of this requirement\\nin the growth of western institutions, then we must say that\\nthere is something within the law of property for which\\nChristianity stands, and will always stand.\\n\\nLet us put the matter this way: in every social institu-\\ntion there are elements relative to the total internal bal-\\nance of its particular society, and also elements of perma-\\nnent validity. It is a current superstition that the rela-\\ntive, where it exists, excludes the absolute; the truth is that\\nabsolute and relative are commonly blended. And the\\npresence of an absolute may be suspected even when its\\nclean extraction long defies our efforts.\\n\\nIf this is the case with property, it is even more true of\\nthe family. There is such a thing as “the Christian fam-\\nily”; it has somthing to do with that same Christian rever-\\nence for individual souls and their freedom, the equal\\ndignity of man, woman, child, the consequent call for adult\\nchoice in this the most momentous human alliance, and\\nfor a one-to-one partnership. It is perhaps not too much\\nto say that the “Christian family” comes close to being an\\nabsolute, for Christianity a necessary consequence of its\\nown universal precepts. For the family is the most direct\\nembodiment of human love; and human love is, in its own\\ncomplete self-consciousness, inseparable from the love of\\n\\n«°\\'W. E.

This freedom\\nof Christianity from whole commitment to social institu-\\ntions may be regarded as itself an institution, and as such,\\nan institution whose position approaches that of an abso-\\nlute. Though still misunderstood, particularly in America,\\nthe degree of mutual independence which modernity has\\nachieved as between church and state must be reckoned\\namong its most important and durable accomplishments,\\nbecause by its aid individual freedom receives its most\\npertinent setting. As the church has released its claim\\nupon, and so its responsibility for, the acts of the secular\\nstate, the state ipso facto has released the church to define\\nits own province. But since that province is the revealing\\nto individual souls of the way to their own integration, the\\nstate in freeing the church accepts the freedom of indi-\\nviduals to define their own ultimate loyalties. The central\\nmotivation of each individual is thus placed beyond the\\nreach of the state, with the state’s consent, and at the same\\ntime beyond any but the persuasive power of the church.\\nWhat is genuinely universal in the field of will-aims is thus\\nenabled to rise before the mind to its due level at the time\\nand in the way suited to the life pilgrimage of each person.\\n\\nAmong all the fields of free action, this is the one of\\nabsolute importance: it is the one unalienable element of\\nmodern liberty; it is a right no institution can give nor\\ntake away, but it is here institutionally protected from the\\ndominance of institutions.\\n\\nAnd with this liberty is wrapped up whatever is uni-\\nvérsal in the principle of democracy and in the bills of\\nrights characteristic of modern constitutions. In their\\nspecific forms, the actual democracies and the listed “rights\\nof man” include much that is not absolute. No religion\\ncould endure the load of attempting to inject into the com-\\nCHRISTIANITY : ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 133\\n\\ning world order, let us say, American democracy as a re-\\nquirement of God’s kingdom. But whatever is universal\\nthere—and it is present—can be found in its relation to\\nthe fundamental liberty and dignity of the person which\\nChristianity can define.*?\\n\\nIn sum, what we can clearly assert in regard to the insti-\\ntutional load which Christianity as particular religion has\\nto carry is a twofold judgment. First, its modern experi-\\nence has freed it from the sponsorship of any western in-\\nstitution as it stands. It is the perpetual critic of “Chris-\\ntion institutions”; its criterion of criticism is always the\\ndegree in which the institution in question fulfills the pre-\\ncept of love to God and neighbor, a precept of the spirit,\\nfrom which no concrete institution can be deduced. Second,\\nthis precept does contain an affirmative social requirement.\\nIt carries corollaries as to elements of social structure—it\\ncreates as well as criticizes; only, its creative force has to\\nassociate itself with all other factors going to make up a\\npositive national or continental culture. What it contrib-\\nutes tends to coincide with what can be recognized as ab-\\nsolute within a resultant clothed in relativity.\\n\\nIn any case, the essence of the Christian precept is at\\nthe same time the essence of whatever social gospel Chris-\\ntianity may bear into the world civilization before us.\\nChristianity is thereby relieved of any burden of “western-\\nism” its institutional associations may appear to impose,\\napart from its own central spirit. It is relieved logically,\\nthough psychologically it will doubtless be held guilty by\\nassociation, until by the renewal of its creative vitality it\\n\\n4T1t is the function of a philosophy freed from contemporary con-\\nformities to define the necessities in law and custom that underlie the\\npurely positive.

It is all the more urgent that it realize at the present\\njuncture its identity with its simple essence, visibly uni-\\nversal.\\n\\nNote on the internal diversity of Christianity:\\n\\nTo call for reconception in the direction of simplification, by\\nidentifying Christianity with its essence, raises the insistent\\nproblem of the pluralism and diversity of the Christian move-\\nment. It is especially during the modern period that Christian-\\nity has become multiform to an extent embarrassing to any\\ndiscussion of its character which proceeds as if it has a single\\ncharacter. These internal differences, though in the end they\\nmay actually contribute to its clarity, do for the present tend\\nto obscure it.\\n\\nThe Protestant movement, in the interest of a freedom essen-\\ntial to the very concept of religion, has opened a gate to\\nanother freedom far more questionable—the freedom of anyone\\nto identify what he personally sees, as the content of his own\\nfaith—to identify this with Christianity forthwith. I have\\ninsisted on seeing as the foundation of believing; I have as-\\nsumed, however, a rigorous veracity in reporting what one sees.\\nIf the mystic is an honest reporter, what he reports will doubt-\\nless be a part of Christianity: it may not be the whole. The\\nnecessary liberty to declare and spread one’s vision, inter-\\npreted as a liberty to establish a new sect of Christianity, has\\nbeen so far magnified as to beget doubt in the pure observer as\\nto whether there is an identical being rightfully claiming that\\nname.\\n\\nMy own feeling about the multiplicity of sects is that most\\nof them that have become a factor in contemporary society\\nhave had some reason for existence: most “reforms” have been\\nneeded. But that the function of reform should be a function\\nprovided for within the church, not calling for schism, but for\\nself-searching and reconception, in the persuasion that variety\\nof expression which is not hostile to the essence may contribute\\nto the life of the church. Differences become splits only if those\\nCHRISTIANITY: ITS CHARACTER AND FUTURE ROLE 135\\n\\nwho hold the prior faith think that they have the whole truth\\n—without excess and unimprovable. On this score, I am of the\\nopinion that the variety is far in excess of what is necessary,\\ninasmuch as very few variants of Christianity today would\\nreject the simple essences here defined, and which are to this\\nextent sufficient to unite them,\\n\\nThere is a sense in which Quakerism, whose genuine Chris-\\ntianity few will doubt, has best caught the genius of a par-\\nticularity that is also universal. Quakerism is today giving\\npowerful evidence of its universality, not only within but out-\\nside the Christian organizations, by exploring and finding\\ncommon ground with mystical tendencies of Buddhism in\\nJapan and of Hinduism in India. (Douglas Steere, “The\\nQuaker Message,” in Christian Century, Aug. 3, 1955.) If it\\ntends to be in our time a common interpreter between religions,\\nthat is not to be taken as proof that validity in positive reli-\\ngion is dependent on minimality in organization and creedal\\nelaboration, though it is clearly facilitated thereby. But it does\\nsuggest that the search for essence may still go far in the\\ndirection of simplicity without losing the substance of the\\nmatter. And in my view simplicity is still the great desidera-\\ntum.\\n\\nThere is also a sense in which the conception of the church\\nin its historic continuity, in its involvement with all the arts—\\nan involvement not canceled by their liberation—and in its\\nwide-flung responsibility for the souls of men, is best realized\\nin the churches called Catholic.\\n\\nI have known of a priest mounting a ladder set against the\\nwall of a burning brick prison, to administer the sacrament to\\na prisoner doomed to die in the flames behind immovable iron\\nbars—the priest being the only human being in that community\\nto feel that concern and that responsibility. I have no inclina-\\ntion to subscribe to the special theological views which made\\nthat sacrament important. I have every respect for the spirit-\\nual community that could inspire that deed of danger, fellow-\\nship, and hope in the love of God.\\n\\nQuaker and Catholic together bear their partials of a total\\ntruth, which includes the truth of a continuing historical com-\\nmunity of aggressive caritas at once material and spiritual.\\n136 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThe Christian movement as a whole contains them both and\\nmuch between them, without, as yet, a visible or conceptual\\nsynthesis. But not without a bond of meaning that can already\\nbe felt. In their coexistence, they constitute an enduring neces-\\nsity for internal advance in self-understanding. And by that\\nsame sign, they exclude exclusiveness.\\n\\nIs Christianity, then, as a whole, universal? My answer\\nis that it is on the way to become universal, and that its\\ntravail through the western passes of modernity has quali-\\nfied it, and requires it, to take a certain leadership in meet-\\ning the religious problems of the coming civilization. But\\nfurther that this leadership can be held only by a humility,\\nready to acknowledge its own continuing need for recon-\\nception, in view of its present unfinishedness, and also of\\nthe depth and breadth of the religious experience of other\\nlands. The moment calls for a heightened severity of self-\\nconsciousness on the part of all religion.\\n\\nThis labor of reconception is going forward.

Affirmation Is not Exclusion\\n\\nTue intention of universality is not peculiar to any one\\nreligion. As our present century has justified the instinc-\\ntive assumption of the human self that its thinking and\\nvaluing are the thinking and valuing of every man, so it\\njustifies his equally instinctive assumption that his address-\\nof-prayer is the address of every man. There is an inherent\\nuniversality in the religious attitude itself that eternally\\ncounteracts the localism implied in the complementary\\nnecessity that religious observance and thought shall in-\\nvolve the whole man in his concrete social insertion. Every\\nreligion that reaches the degree of self-understanding fit-\\nting it for a career in the modernity inspired civilization\\nwe find gathering around us will know its own calling to\\nuniversality. Less than ever is head-on clash a guide to\\ntruth and sanity, or to the discovery of a genuine religious\\ngoal for man.\\n\\n* Portions of Study V appeared in The Hibbert Journal, July, 1956.\\n\\n137\\n138 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nIf, as I have held, faith is based on what a man sees, and\\nnot on what he merely supposes, Christian faith does not\\npresent itself as an hypothesis competing with other hy-\\npotheses: it exists at all only as it is verified in personal\\nexperience. This verification is affirmative: “This Way is a\\nway to peace.” As affirmative, it is not exclusive. The pos-\\nsibility remains that it is the only way to peace, a possibil-\\nity often maintained and one we must consider. Here I\\nsimply point out that the verifying experience does not\\ncontain in itself any assertion to the effect that other ways\\nare false: it implies no rejection of the vision of the true\\nmystic wherever found, if there be any other true mystic—\\na doubt which followers of Christ have at times expressed,\\nbut which Christ himself was free from. And the word of\\nhim whom I have called the unbound Christ appears to re-\\nject any such rejection: he who stands and has stood at\\nthe door of every man must have done so under various\\nguises.\\n\\nLet me repeat that what I mean by “the true mystic” is\\nsimply the person who in the course of his own experience\\nhas in some moment become aware of the nature of things\\nas supreme good. The awareness of Being, which is inces-\\nsant and inescapable but almost always obscured by “the\\nten thousand things,” comes abruptly to clarity unmixed.\\nAt some point he has broken through the illusions of men-\\ntal habit ; he has perceived that the apparent finality of the\\nphysical detail of experience is unreal, that the seemingly\\nindependent “fact” is dependent, that Being in its truth is\\nBeatitude and kindred to himself. Such vision may come\\nwholly outside the lines of formal religion, as it came to\\nJohn Masefield—purely as “illumination” replacing “a\\nblack night of despair.”? Or it may come in the way of\\n\\n180 Long to Learn, 189, 180,\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 139\\n\\nmeditative discipline, as it may have come to Plotinus or to\\nPlato. Or still more simply and widely, in the waking of the\\nmind to love and the opening of the eyes to beauty, when\\nthese experiences are, as they may be, entrance gates to\\nthe nature of Being.\\n\\nIn the Orient and especially in India this experience is\\noften deliberately sought under the name of “realization.”\\nIndeed, India while in many ways the most speculative and\\nimaginative of all cultures in the field of religion, is also\\nthe most empirical in this sense of seeking an experience\\nof union with the divine, and of making extraordinary\\nefforts and sacrifices for its attainment. As contrasted with\\nChristianity, the religions of India commonly encourage a\\nspiritual athleticism in which realization is felt to be\\nearned by personal effort, whereas for the Christian it is,\\nin the end, felt to be a gift of grace, In India, too, the\\ndivine is often regarded as beyond personality, and union\\ntherewith a merging and loss of separate selfhood; whereas\\nfor the Christian the discovery is one of being prized as a\\nperson by a person. And further, while for the Indian\\nmystic the achievement of samadhi may tend to remove him\\nfrom the world of affairs as a world of Maya, and may\\nculminate in his final release from illusion and from rebirth,\\nit belongs to the genius of Christian mysticism that its\\nrealization is a phase of an alternation which makes him a\\nrevitalized participant in the historic work of the kingdom\\nof God on earth.\\n\\nBut these contrasts are relative, There is nothing more\\npersonal than the religion of Tagore, a Brahma Samaj\\nHinduism, whose “religion of man” tends to find the divine\\nencounter through such human offices as those of the guru.\\nTagore is doubtless influenced by his knowledge of Chris-\\ntianity, but even more by a type of people’s mysticism cur-\\n140 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nrent in parts of Bengal, that of the Baiils (many of whose\\nsongs he has set to music), who believe that they will meet\\nthe divine One in person, in some incidental human en-\\ncounter, and will at the end join “Him” beyond humanity:\\n\\nAnd Thon, with what name wilt Thou call me?\\nThou wilt lift me from the water,\\nAnd there, under the shelter of Thine arm,\\nClose to Thy heart,\\nWilt extinguish the burning of the long, long journey.\\n\\nAs for the motive of escape, certainly more prominent\\nin the orthodoxies of Buddhism and Hinduism, we must\\nrecall that if the Enlightenment of the Buddha, according\\nto the legend which everyone knows, led to his deliberately\\nputting away the call of Nirvana because of his compassion\\nfor unenlightened mankind, Buddhism cannot be disposed\\nof as “the Way of Escape”’: it is also the Denial of Escape\\nas ultimate good, a denial repeated by the succession of\\nBodhisattvas. And if this is true of original Buddhism,\\nthe developed Mahayana of today is still more a call to\\nman to find worth in human living by developing the\\nBuddha nature within each one.\\n\\nThese several variants of mystic experience are thus not\\nincompatible. All of them, including that of the Christian,\\ncall for a certain discipline,” and for a certain removal for\\nrecollection from the immediate strain of affairs, as a\\nphase of alternation. All of them, including the most tech-\\nnical—as Yoga or Zen—and the most untechnical and\\nspontaneous—the initiation into Being of which human\\nlove is capable—normally bring a healing gift of the same\\n\\n* The earlier Christian enthusiasm sought a discipline more deliberate\\nand systematic than at present.

How can modern man\\nfind his rational way amid their diversity, or tolerate their\\naberrations?\\n\\nii. Three Postulates for the Relations of Religions\\n\\nTue relations between the several religions will be\\nhelped toward clarity if we observe the following forces\\nconstantly in play. We may state them as a set of postu-\\nlates:\\n\\n(a) The true mystic will recognize the true mystic\\nacross all boundaries, and will learn from him;\\n\\n(b) Every man’s religion must be “a” religion, having\\n142 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nits own simplicity of essence, its organic integrity, and its\\nhistoric identity ;\\n\\n(c) To every man belongs the full truth of religion—\\nthe unlosable essences in whatever context they appear,\\nand also their interpretation through history.\\n\\nWe consider each of these postulates:\\n\\n(a) The true mystic will recognize the true mystic. It\\nis all but fruitless to seek for criteria. There is, indeed, a\\nbroad pragmatic test, “by their fruits.” The objective\\nobserver, being devoid of “the ear to hear,” has to use this\\ntest, and so the state. The test is useful especially in its\\nnegative form: if the fruit is idleness, sensuality, disorder,\\nthe mysticism is fraudulent. Mass movements against a\\nmonastic life deemed parasitical and barren, as in the\\nsweeping revolts against early Buddhism in China and in\\nthe disorders in England long ago, along the Scottish\\nborder, suggest the common human basis for this judg-\\nment. In a still broader sense, in so far as the religions of\\nAsia have been, in fact, an opiate of the people, and have\\ndeferred the rational attack on poverty, the powerful ele-\\nment of mysticism in them is suspect of imperfect defini-\\ntion. And at the same time, this mysticism is near to its\\ngreatest service, the source of a cosmic patience and faith\\nthat has sustained the hearts of millions under a persistent\\nprivation which they, the common people, had no way to\\nremedy.® But the relevant and positive test is immediate: it\\nlies in the spirit of the man; in his attainment of\\npeace.\\n\\nGandhi was often invited to declare himself a Christian ;\\nhe was such in spirit and effect; he consistently and kindly\\ndeclined on the ground that “God had placed him in\\nIndia,” and he could do much for Hinduism by working\\n\\n3 See my book, Haperiment in Education, 159 f.\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 148\\n\\nfrom within, as indeed he did. But one day (I am told) an\\nEnglish churchman who had argued the subject with him\\ncame to the final question: “Have you attained peace?”\\nWhen Gandhi answered, “I have peace,” the reply was,\\n“Then I have nothing more to say to you.” The direct\\nrecognition by Irwin and Gandhi of the true mystic, each\\nin the other, has been important for the peaceful character\\nof the great turn of Indian history in 1947. But the recog-\\nnition I speak of may be as well illustrated in events almost\\ntrifling and momentary.\\n\\nNorth of Hangchow there was in 1982 a new Taoist\\ntemple, founded by a Cantonese merchant who desired to\\nrestore Taoism to its original purity. I found there an old\\ngardener, keeping a loving eye and hand on his plantings; and\\nin the entire absence of a common language had a few words\\nwith him. I knew that his plants were to him a manifestation of\\nthe Tao, whose polar factors, Yang and Yin, entered into all\\nliving things. As he spoke of them, I have seldom seen so beau-\\ntiful a human face, inlighted with a sense of communing with\\nthe source of the life that was in his keeping. Through his\\ngarden-tending he was doing what Lao Tze called “returning\\nto the root”: we might call it prayer, in the sense of the Bene-\\ndictine for whom laborare est orare.\\n\\nWith such recognition, wherever it occurs, there comes\\nat least a readier disposition—perhaps a sort of mandate\\n—to discern convergence, under wide differences of expres-\\nsion, in the meaning of essences and observances among\\ndifferent faiths.\\n\\nEven the great induction of Christianity, he that loseth\\nhis life for my sake the same shall find it, even this master\\nprecept nowhere else so radically and compactly expressed,\\nceases to stand alone. Indeed, as we noted, it would hardly\\nbe so persuasive an essence unless some inkling of its pur-\\nport had been widely felt.\\n144 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nIt has some kinship with the universal symbol of re-\\nnunciation as a condition of insight, sometimes taking the\\nphysical form of austerity as a preparation for worship.\\nIn all religions, the capacity for renunciation has been\\nhonored as a sign of spiritual power; it has contributed to\\nthe influence of a Gandhi, as well as of a Francis or a Savo-\\nnarola. Its root does not lie in vocal convention: wherever\\nspiritual ambition appears, some spontaneous curbing of\\nnatural impulse occurs as an intuitively felt condition of\\nthe life-saving subordination of instinct. It is understood\\nby Spinoza as clearly as by Augustine.\\n\\nI had long supposed that Confucius, recommending a\\n“Middle Path” as a primary moral principle, lacked an\\nunderstanding of the firm radicalism of self-sacrifice,\\ncharacteristic of the Christian absolutes. (And since it is\\nonly in presence of such absolutes that any man can judge\\nhis own moral status, their relative absence from any tradi-\\ntion might account for a prevalent once-born-ness to which\\na sense of sin could seem alien.) But I have recently come\\non a phrase that throws light on the inner greatness of the\\naging master in his courageous persistence, despite re-\\npeated failure and occasional physical assault, in the effort\\nto persuade local rulers to good government. The phrase\\n“Ssu ming lun,” which Wing-tsit Chan translates “Wait-\\ning for the Heavenly Mandate,” * may be interpreted\\n“Accepting without complaint whatever fortune may at-\\ntend the carrying-out of one’s Heaven-appointed task”—\\nmany words for a brief Chinese phrase, but that is the\\nnature of brief Chinese phrases! Mencius comments that\\nthis loyal persistence may involve death. And certainly,\\nthe danger-defying dedication of Confucius to his teaching\\nmission, like that of Socrates, has been a potent factor in\\n\\n4Chan Wing-tsit, Religious Trends in Modern China, 29.\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 145\\n\\nthe enduring aliveness of his message. The principle of\\nlosing life to save it is there.\\n\\nAnd I know of no other great tradition in which there is\\nnot a latent acceptance or adumbration of this principle,\\nnot yet given the place of priority that belongs to it. So far\\nas this is the case Christianity, through its inductive power,\\nmay provide an interpretation by whose aid these ap-\\nproaches may be reconceived within their own context. And\\nthey, in turn, will provide for the Christian dictum a re-\\nconception in terms of breadth: the Christian will know\\nbetter what his own precept means as he sees its identity\\nunder widely different conceptual auspices, such as those\\nof the Chinese Ming, the Mandate of Heaven.\\n\\nThe intuitive recognition of mystic by mystic is thus\\nthe perceptive clue through which the formidable opposi-\\ntions between the great positive religions are to some ex-\\ntent bridged. Their incompatibilities are reduced to their\\nresidual dimensions. The age before us will be to just that\\nextent relieved of unreal contentions or estrangements.\\nAnd few things discredit the position of organized religion\\nin the mind of modern man so much as artificial or verbal\\nantagonisms on the part of the one association devoted to\\nthe moral unity of mankind.\\n\\nNot all incompatibilities will be thus disposed of; but\\nthis process of reduction will enable us to define the resi-\\ndue, and to assess their future.\\n\\n(b) Every man’s religion must be “a” religion, having\\nits own simplicity of essence and its own integrity, averse\\nto the harboring of inwardly discordant or superfluous\\nelements.\\n\\n5 Philosophy East and West, IV, 2 (July, 1954), 179-81, a review of\\nChan’s book by Richard and W. E. Hocking.\\n146 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nSince the mystic’s recognition of the true mystic is\\nlimited by no conceptual boundaries, it is prima facie at\\nodds with the idea that any one confession is the “Only\\nWay” of finding God. If this be “Liberalism,” it is but\\nGod’s own liberalism,-whose light “lighteth every man.”\\nBut it cannot serve as our sole guide.\\n\\nFor if we thereupon say that all ways are good ways,\\nand add (as Ramakrishna inclined to do) that all ways are\\nequally good, we fall into an Indifferentism that evades\\ndeep-going issues. And if we say that each man’s religion\\nis the right way for him, despite material divergences, we\\nadopt a Relativism equally negligent, and which has noth-\\ning to offer to a coming world order committed to a pur-\\nsuit of universal truth, in religion as in science. Science\\nitself has a sort of “Only Way”—its method: as Dewey\\npoints out, “There is but one sure road of access to truth—\\nthe road of patient, cooperative enquiry.” ° Likewise the\\nOnly Way position in religion has at least the similar merit\\nof rejecting passivity before crucial issues of truth and\\nerror, valid faith and superstition, right and wrong, if\\nsuch issues exist. As they do.\\n\\nThe Only Way in religion has a further merit, that of\\nintolerance toward a Syncretism which is disposed to bor-\\nrow here and there what seems to be good, encouraged no\\ndoubt by the mystic’s recognition, piecing together frag-\\nments of true insight from various sources to compose an\\neclectic whole, devoid of any principle of coherence. I do\\nnot mean that such patchwork borrowing is wrong: if\\nsomething is found good, it is already yours; you cannot\\ndisown it. The way to an honest breadth must begin with\\nsuch borrowing, as it were a tentative syncretism. But it\\nmust come to wnity with whatever else you have. A man’s\\n\\n® Dewey, op. cit., 32.\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 147\\n\\nreligion must be one thing, in the sense of having a central\\nessence which commands all else. Your borrowing, then,\\nmust be the beginning of a thinking process, Either that\\ngood thing you have found belongs uniquely to the reli-\\ngious organism from which it came—in which case you\\nmust adopt that unity—or it belongs to yours—in which\\ncase you must reconceive the essence of your own faith, to\\ninclude that new element.” You cannot live religiously\\nwithin a divided house, or a house whose roof covers only\\npart of its floor area!\\n\\nThis demand for integrity is intuitive as well as logical.\\nWhether or not the priests and theologians of any faith\\nare able to reach agreement as to what the essence of the\\nfaith is, the individual adherent, as he pronounces the\\nsacred name or “takes refuge in the Dharma,” must be\\nable to feel himself at one in thought and spirit not only\\nwith fellow adherents but also with the saints in that tradi-\\ntion through the ages of its history. For this reason, a\\nGandhi, so much in accord with Christianity in precept\\nand action, could not find this accord a sufficient reason for\\nseparation from Hinduism: his deeper intuitions were\\nthere—he said to me that the name “Rama” remained to\\nhim the most intimate and significant of the names of God\\n—and he believed he could reach unity by incorporating\\nhis new insights within the body of a reinterpreted Hindu-\\nism. To achieve this, he so radically reconceived Hinduism\\nas to call forth fierce hostility in some centers of strict\\nHindu orthodoxy. Finally his integrity cost him his life.\\n\\nIt is just this necessary insistence on inner unity that\\nleaves us with a plurality of integral faiths. If postulate\\n\\nThis is the specific process of “reconception” which I have earlier\\ndefined as the unit step in the growing process of every living religion,\\nits dialectic in which faith co-operates with thought. Living Religions and\\na World Faith, 190-98,\\n148 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\none tends to bring the religions together, postulate two\\ntends to confirm their separate outlines. Are we then com-\\nmitted to an enduring plurality of religions, each aspiring\\nto universal scope, and each held by its center to be the\\nOnly Way?\\n\\n(c) To every man belongs the full truth of religion—\\nthe unlosable essences in whatever context they appear,\\nand their interpretation through history.\\n\\nThe destinies of religion in the age now arriving will not\\nbe governed chiefly by the findings of scholars or priests,\\nbut rather by what men everywhere seek as filling their\\nneed for an inner peace. To every man, the West and the\\nEast alike will naturally contribute whatever is universal\\nin their cultures, no longer as western or eastern, but as\\nhis own. This, which already holds of the sciences, holds\\nin principle of religion also, though what is universal in\\nreligion is made less available by the diversities we are\\ndealing with, and their various geographical centers of\\ndiffusion. It is well to note that the plurality that results\\nis largely illusory.\\n\\nSo far as the essences of precept and doctrine are con-\\ncerned, the agréements which the mystics discern are not\\nsimilarities, they are identities. Each man in following the\\nWay of his faith is, of course, regarding that Way as uni-\\nversal—otherwise it would not be his faith. His religion is\\nhis private self-dedication to Being, which is one, and\\ntherewith his bond to the ideal community of mankind.\\nConsciously or not, each one is seeking not “a” Way, but\\nthe “Only Way”: just as any scientist is concerned to have\\nnot “a” truth, but The Truth, so the worshiper in what-\\never name will consider his way the Only Way, not as a\\nproprietary nostrum but as The Truth indivisible and The\\nLife, and as universal for just that reason. And con-\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 149\\n\\nversely, whatever else in religion is universal is ipso facto\\npart of it, and his own.\\n\\nThus understood, the Only Way, so far as its essence has\\nby valid induction achieved finality, is no longer the Way\\nthat marks out one religion from all others: it is the Way\\nalready present in all, either explicitly or in ovo. The sev-\\neral universal religions are already fused together, so to\\nspeak, at the top.® The primary identity involved in the\\nrecognition of mystic by mystic is the essence of the reli-\\ngious world view, the perception of Being as beatitude—\\nGod is, and God is One. With this final and universal truth\\nwhatever is implied in it, and that is much, is already im-\\nplicitly the possession of every believer within his own\\nfaith. And as we have just seen, there is wide identity in\\na major essence of precept. So far, the religions of man-\\nkind—Buddhism not excluded—are already one reli-\\ngion. The area of this agreement-and-unity is subject to\\ncontinuous enlargement by the processes of mystic recogni-\\ntion and reconception.\\n\\nThe recognition that there are finalities in religion is\\nthe condition under which alone the unity of religion is\\nnot only a hope, but in some measure an actuality, The\\nusual “Only Way” doctrine has the special virtue, in an\\nera of mental flabbiness, of recognizing that there is such\\na thing as finality within our reach, such as we have indi-\\ncated in the unlosable intuitions of Christianity. The Flux-\\nphilosophers who find nothing not subject to change, and\\nwho in the field of religion can provide no firm center of\\nassurance in the increasingly grave problem of motivation,\\nhave something to learn from the Only Way proponent.\\nThe region of the changeless need not be great. I am in\\nmind of a remark by Royce reported by Max Otto when\\n\\n8 See above, p. 138,\\n150 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsomeone asked him the object of his teaching: “I wish to\\ngive my students a little place on which to set their feet”\\n—a spot of stability in a world of change. If religion gives\\nits whole content over to the principle panta rei, it has\\nsurrendered its major function.\\n\\nili. The Positive Religions Retain\\nMarks of Distinction\\n\\nBur there remain the historical and personal factors\\nunaffected by these rapprochements.\\n\\nRegional histories have long since merged in a world\\nhistory; but the several courses of experience that have\\nformed the vital arguments of development within the\\nvarious faiths remain as distinct as the persons of their\\nfounders. And if the history of a religion is a factor in its\\ndefinition, diversities of history cannot but imply continu-\\ning diversities of essence.\\n\\nFurther, these histories of religion have been at the same\\ntime deeply involved with the histories of culture. They\\nhave been engaged in the molding of customs and laws, of\\nmyth and of art, and especially of observance—a language\\nbeyond language whose field is extensive and strangely\\ndurable. There are the holy days, modes of prayer, taboos,\\ncharms, magic techniques, feasts, special ceremonies to\\nnote the vital crises, birth, maturity, marriage, death, sac-\\nraments, invocations of special powers for community\\ncrises and the major enterprises of the economic year.\\n\\nIn brief, particular religion is the leaven of the spirit of\\ntribes and nations. Its observances can with difficulty be\\nkept to one side of the religious-secular boundary: witness\\nthe vast public (and commercial) import of the Christmas\\nholiday, the stamping of the European business calendar\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 151\\n\\nby the Christian week and yearly festivals whose momen-\\ntum carries far beyond the Christian world, as in the ac-\\ncommodation of Turkish bank holidays to those of Europe\\n. . « Religion, I say, permeates the spirit of nations; and\\nnationhood, with all its past crimes and its peril for future\\nworld unity, is not destined to disappear.\\n\\nHere I am obliged to record dissent from the outlook\\nof Toynbee, and from that of many another messenger of\\ngood will to men, including Albert Einstein, appalled by\\nthe horrors let loose on the world by the egoism of nation-\\nstates, and by the far greater horrors now at the service of\\npolitical passion, My dissent is based on the judgment\\nthat just because civilization is becoming one and world-\\nwide, the localisms which preserve the world from monot-\\nony, and conserve those precious semi-solitudes in which\\nalone thought and fine art and every creative impulse\\nflourish, must be the more vigorously protected and prized.\\nAnd these nationalisms, normally held from excess by the\\ngrowing effectiveness of the world-wide treasury of the\\nuniversal, in science, economy, law, faith, are inseparable\\nfrom the local history of religion.\\n\\nAs evidence, consider the new national impulses of Asia\\nand their bearing on ancient faiths. Just now, Buddhism\\nand Hinduism in India, long in decline, are again lifting\\ntheir heads.® Japan’s experience is peculiarly instructive,\\nsince its phenomenal commitment to modernity and its un-\\n\\n® “Hinduism and Buddhism are by no means dead in India. They . . .\\nare proclaiming themselves today as the new hope of humanity” (D. G.\\nMoses, Christian Century, Mar. 30, 1955), This statement recalls the\\nwelcome given by Pandit N. N. DasGupta at the opening of the\\nBuddhist temple at Sarnath, Sept., 1981: a welcome to the coming\\n“Hindu-Buddhist civilization of India,” and of Asia, The hyphen marks\\na burial of ancient hostilities between these faiths—a burial hardly con-\\n\\nceivable prior to World War I which published to the East a breach in\\nChristendom, to DasGupta “a failure” of Christianity.\\n152 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nparalleled rapidity of secular adaptation might have\\ntended to obliterate its sympathy with tradition. Instead,\\nJapan some time ago devised a new relationship to religious\\ntradition: it adhered to Shinto as a national outlook, care-\\nfully distinguished (by official definition) from religious-\\nand-sectarian Shinto; and this adherence, with its corre-\\nsponding observances, was in my opinion an important\\nfactor in the notable nonreceptivity, prior to the recent\\nwar, of the Japanese public to the spread of antinational-\\nist communism.”? The effectiveness of Shinto in this respect\\ncomes not from any doctrinal formula, and certainly not\\nfrom specific divine figures, but from the rootage of the\\ndistinctive Japanese culture—its art, love of nature, cus-\\ntom, heroic ideals . . . in the symbols of Shinto tradition.\\n\\nThere is here no wish to preserve from passing that\\nwhich is outworn—as Shinto’s involvement with a hier-\\narchical social order, already distasteful to Japanese youth\\n—nor to hold in the position of literal faith that which is\\nmoving and ought to move into the region of myth. The\\nacids of modernity will quietly do their own work. But we\\ncan and must treat with reverence the unanalyzed sources\\nof the individuality of historic cultures. We must respect\\nthe enduring germ of vitality in what Royce called “the\\nWe,” whose quasi-personal being is a factor in the selfhood\\nof each member-person. To say of these older religions, as\\nsuggested by an Evanston report, that they “have no\\nmessage of abiding hope” is to utter a judgment that\\nmight be drawn from comparing texts, but never from\\nconsidering the hearts of common men long sustained by\\nthese faiths. They, too, the folk, are among the mystics.\\n\\n10The present postwar period in which Japan is drawn powerfully\\n“ee sympathy with Asian antiwesternism has a radically different\\nalance,\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 153\\n\\nWhen nationalism becomes itself a religion, or when the\\nchurch identifies itself with the interests of the state, true\\nreligion is dead, In the civilization now coming, there is no\\nmore place for “national religions” than for chosen people.\\nNor is any national character or temperament permanent ;\\nancient observances have a tendency to outlive the mean-\\nings that begot them. The fortunate plasticity of nation-\\nhood is a condition of the swift growths and swift sharings\\nof culture involved in the reaching of a world civilization.\\nYet for any epoch, there is such a thing as national per-\\nsonality, and therewith national mission. The nation-group\\ncan lend a necessary touch of domesticity to the law-mak-\\ning association, whereby the total positive law of that\\ngroup becomes a distinctive experiment in living. Through\\nthis genuine, even if passing, personal quality, ideas are\\nborn, inherently universal. It is only in the relatively se-\\neret places of the world that creativity takes place for the\\nrenewal of the life of all. Religion will therefore always\\nhave two functions in reference to this national being: that\\nof transcending all national limits, and that of maintaining\\nwith loving piety the permanent values of domesticity in\\nthe interior groupings of mankind.”\\n\\nFor a world civilization must be an organism, not an\\nendless homogeneity. No more desolating prospect could\\nconfront mankind than that of undifferentiated identity in\\nthe sacred begettings of culture. The quest for a world\\nfaith must retain, in its care for the whole, a continuing\\nsolicitude for its diverse members. And not alone for the\\nsake of the worshipers whose ancestral reverences are in-\\nvolved, but also for the sake of that total human experi-\\nence to which belongs the full truth of religion.\\n\\n11 Hocking, Man and the State, 267, 372; The Spirit of World Politics,\\n186 f., 194,\\n154 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nOur three postulates for the interrelation of faiths have\\nbrought us to no goal, working as they have to some extent\\nat cross-purposes. They have led us to the perception that\\nan incipient world faith already exists, though not in the\\nshape of “a” religion positive and historic. The immediate\\nvista for the coming civilization is that of a continued\\ncoexistence of at least a few of the great faiths.\\n\\nThis coexistence can no longer be one of mutual effort\\nfor displacement. The advance toward a world cultivation\\nproceeds under a disposition close to the essence of all\\ncivilization which we may call reverence for reverence—\\nsomething far away from toleration—with the general in-\\nsight that no soul through defects in the particulars of its\\nfaith stands apart from the mercy of God.\\n\\nThis does not mean that abuses in religion are not to be\\nnoted and given their right names. Whatever makes reli-\\ngion important makes its aberrations the more deplorable,\\nand the more traitorous to the common quest; for in a\\ncivilization of increasing general enlightenment and hu-\\nmanism, positive religion always faces the issue of its own\\nexistence. The worship of idols has always to be denounced\\nin plain terms. Nor is this worship less prevalent now than\\nin ancient days: it is more so. The advance of civilization\\nbut changes its form; for it lies in the nature of civilization\\nto deify its man-made winnings. There is no civilization in\\nwhich the admonition of the Hindu mystic is not needed:\\nNeti, neti—‘it is not that!” There is no achieved good\\nwhich is not invited to pose as The Good—liberty, equal-\\nity, the standard of living, democracy, the nation itself,\\ngood fortune and the benevolence of the fortunate—all\\nsuch goods stand on the perilous slope toward a false ab-\\nsolutism. And it is always the office of religion to refuse the\\nplace of perfection to the near-perfect. In this sense its\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 155\\n\\nGod is always a jealous God: his jealousy is identical with\\nhis stern love for the soul’s purity.\\n\\nHatred of the idol as god-pretender, legitimate and nec-\\nessary passion of original Judaism, does not of itself today\\nset one religion against another nor justify a self-righteous\\nseparatism ; for this hatred is in the lifeblood of every liv-\\ning religion. It is the domestic issue for every reformer.\\nWherever we recognize this holy austerity, whether in\\nBuddha or Jesus or al-Hallaj or Gandhi or others, there\\nspeaks, or should speak, our reverence for reverence. At\\nthe same time the coexistence of the great faiths cannot be\\npassive; that would be to fall into the Indifferentism we\\nare bound to reject. The claim of each to universal mean-\\ning implies a universal responsibility; and since religion\\ndoes not, like science, universalize itself, it implies a duty\\nto “go and preach.” If we break the images of idolatry\\nwithin our own house, and solely for our own private good-\\nstanding with the God of truth, we have set up a new idol\\nin doing so. How, then, can coexistence be other than con-\\ntentious, and in a sense competitive?\\n\\nHere we reach the crux of our meditation.\\n\\niv. Immediate Considerations:\\nIndividual Freedom; Consociation\\n\\nTowarp this conflict of duties, our actual situation,\\nthere are two considerations of direct pertinence, and two\\nfurther considerations presiding over the ultimate issue.\\nFirst, for the immediate situation:\\n\\nWith the invasion of the spirit of modernity into all\\ncrannies of the planet, religion by group-belonging be-\\ncomes less and less possible to the man who thinks; and the\\n156 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nman who thinks tends to become everyman.” We have to\\nconsider the intense individuality of the address of religion\\ntoday and of all future religion. There is still a tendency\\nof organized religion to regard itself as having a domain\\nlike that of the nation or the region, like that of the\\nMoslem world or the Roman Catholic districts of Europe\\nor South America, And where religion places its hand\\ndirectly on legislation, that tendency has a concrete raison\\nd’étre, limiting individual freedom to choose through the\\nforce of a well-defined esprit de corps. But here the gains\\nof modernity in the West become the general principle of\\nthe new era: it is not westernism but universal necessity\\nthat religion in its nature must speak to the individual\\nsoul. In the last analysis a religion has no domain, other\\nthan that of the heart’s peace; and the individual heart is\\nthe sole judge of its own peace, and of its need for further\\nsearch. Here freedom must be absolute; and must be ab-\\nsolutely protected, not alone for the weal of the person,\\nbut as well for the solidity of civilization.\\n\\nWe must also consider that the impulse to teach is in-\\nseparable from the impulse to learn, and learning, in reli-\\ngion, means experiencing. Wherever the reverence for\\nreverence exists there will be a willingness to worship with\\nthe worshiper, as Gandhi, the Hindu, was willing to wor-\\nship with the Christian. Each faith has its unlosables,\\nwhich can best be understood by experimental adoption,\\nnot so much in the spirit of Keyserling’s dramatic inquiries\\nas in that of the more serious devotions of Ramakrishna or\\nof Augustine’s credo ut intelligam.\\n\\nCount Hermann von Keyserling in his T\\'ravel Diary\\n\\n124 tendency suffering check in regions where, as in the United\\nStates, mass education is mistaken for democracy in education,\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 157\\n\\nindicates that understanding a faith requires a sort of\\nProtean self-identification with it, for a time; he relates\\nhow for a day or two he “adopted the belief” in Krishna-\\nmurti as a contemporary incarnation, just to see how it\\nwould feel to believe that! Much more genuine do I find\\nthis statement of a Jesuit missionary in India: “India’s\\nproblems I had studied . . . I read books, but the books\\nI liked the most were the hearts of the people I dealt with,\\nespecially the simple and the ignorant. . . . I meditated\\nover the memorials of the birthplaces of Buddhism and\\nJainism, and sat in the caves used by a sect of monks with\\nno spiritual descendants in the world of today. . . . I let\\nchildren and illiterates teach me, and they nearly made me\\nfeel the value of their superstitions. . . .” But most to our\\npresent point is the attitude I met in Professor Adhikari,\\nof the Hindu University of Benares, who finding the doc-\\ntrine of this same Jesuit missionary as to transubstantia-\\ntion difficult, said to him, “We must go together to your\\nMary-chapel and pray there; and perhaps the under-\\nstanding will come to me.” Without losing grip on the firm\\nidentity of his own Way, each can grow in his understand-\\ning of that Way through the added experience of worship\\nwith another in whom the reality of religion is perceived.\\nEach will thereby reconceive his own faith in breadth. And\\nwith the breaking down of the surface shells of insulation,\\nthe natural reasons for preference and decision will assert\\nthemselves.\\n\\nAs the recognition of kinship between different faiths\\nbecomes general, while the call of historical loyalty remains\\nstrong, occasional acts of co-worship may develop freely\\ninto what I have called “consociation,” * as in the “Wider\\n\\n18 In my article, “Missions in a Nationalist Orient,” Christian Century,\\nFeb. 28, 1955.\\n158 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nChristian Fellowship” which once flourished in India, and\\nto some extent in the new association of “National\\nChurches” in India. And consociation, as a limited union\\nbetween faiths for work and worship, is a definite step\\ntoward making the visible institutions more truthfully\\nexpress the realities of identity within difference, moving\\ntoward difference within identity.\\n\\nv. Long-range Considerations:\\nMaturity in Religion\\n\\nBur for the longer look ahead there are two further\\nconsiderations. These arise from the fact that as the one\\ncivilization establishes itself, with the practical insistence\\nof technical and economic issues, the strong drift to a com-\\nmon scientific and secular outlook, the disappearance of\\nthe older colonial structures and the corresponding neces-\\nsities for cultural self-sufficiency everywhere, the tradi-\\ntional problems of religion will tend to be submerged under\\nthe common problems of the new order. Young people will\\nbe keenly aware of the life-and-death issues which all reli-\\ngion faces, as modernity presents itself as a good in itself.\\nThere arises a new perspective on all religious theses and\\nobservances.\\n\\nOne consideration of this new perspective is a recogni-\\ntion of the necessity and incomparable worth of maturity\\nin religion,\\n\\nThe coming of the new perspective has shown itself,\\namong the religions of Asia, in a swift adoption, as in the\\ngurukuls of India, as in Al Azhar, Aligarh, and other\\nMoslem centers of learning, of new curricula including\\nthe sciences together with literatures and philosophies aim-\\ning to orient the mind of man within a radically altered\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 159\\n\\nworld picture. However successful these efforts, they will\\nalmost by necessity fall short of maturity.\\n\\nBy maturity I mean here something more than several\\ncenturies of encounter with the modern outlook. I mean a\\nunion of opposites, such as maturity in organic life im-\\nplies, in which the world views of religion have absorbed\\nand made their own what is valid in the views of its critics.\\nA religion that remains hostile to nature per se or to the\\nscientific spirit is simply not mature; nor is a religion\\nmature that merely accepts science and retreats, priding\\nitself on its up-to-dateness, its realism, its ability to wear\\nsociological garments. Maturity means the glad and in-\\ntelligent adoption of the natural, without the surrender of\\nwhat is more than nature, as the human mind, which thinks\\nnature, obeys nature in its empirical inquiries, and thus\\nmasters nature, is other and more than the nature which is\\nits “object.” It means recognizing that this being-above-\\nnature is also natural, i.e., it is “human nature” to be the\\nknower of (object) nature and the free utilizer of (ob-\\nject) nature. And for this reason the term “nature” is seen\\nto have two meanings, or two boundaries, one of which is\\nlimited to the sphere of events within the given space-time-\\ncausal nexus, and one of which includes with this the sphere\\nof human thought, purpose, and freedom, with whatever\\nwider environment these imply.\\n\\nThere is a “nature” that excludes supernature; there is\\na wider “nature” which includes supernature,* and can\\ntherefore do justice to the nonphysical realities, such as\\nlife, consciousness, man, history, the universal, the eternal.\\nMature religion, continuing like all religion to denounce\\navarice, lust, the indulgence of wrath, and the will to\\ndominate, will at the same time assert the justice of natural\\n\\n14 See above, pp. 102f.\\n160 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ninstinct when held subordinate to a ruling passion of a\\ncreative love (also natural in posse). In rebuking nature\\nit will honor nature, finding in nature itself the standards\\nfor the rebuke of nature.\\n\\nThe great men of all ages have found within their own\\nnatures something that controls and disciplines nature.\\nThe astonishing outburst of Tertullian above referred to,\\n“O testimonium animae naturaliter Christianae” (A polo-\\ngeticus, XVII), was preceded by a reflection less often\\nnoticed, indicating the ground wpon which he felt he could\\nassert that the human mind is Christian by nature. That\\nground seems to me at least as astonishing in its context as\\nthe implied assertion. If I rightly interpret his compact\\nphrases, he says in effect that our knowledge that we can-\\nnot fully grasp the ultimate Being affords evidence that\\nwe have a place in knowledge for what it is that we cannot\\ngrasp. And this place is so important that he can add, Et\\nhaec est summa delicti nolentium recognoscere, quem ig-\\nnorare non possunt—“And this is the highest reach of\\nwrong—the unwillingness to recognize what it is impos-\\nsible to ignore.” In other words, to know that we cannot\\nknow may be our most significant knowledge, the item most\\nperilous to repudiate. This bit of irony—which we now\\nincline to call dialectic—is of a piece with the paradox of\\nSocrates, whose point of superior wisdom was that he alone\\nknew his ignorance. And this, in turn, is of a piece, in quite\\ndifferent language, with the Hebrew dictum, “the fear of\\nthe Lord is the beginning of wisdom”—if we consider “the\\nLord” as the eternal knower of what we do not know, as\\nwell as the Absolute Being, the ever-present yet inaccessible\\ngoal of our own knowing. And if “fear” means the reverent\\nregard (like the mystic’s “mystery”) for the ontological\\nimplication of this so-naturally-human knowledge of the\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 161\\n\\nnumen beyond knowing, our link to beyond-human entity.\\n\\nMaturity in this sense will become a need for all religion.\\nFor with the growing unity of civilization, the mental en-\\nvironment of all religions will contain (to use Toynbee’s\\nterms) the same new challenges, and will call for the same\\nresponses on their part. This demand will press—is already\\npressing—toward simplicity and a care for stark veracity\\nbeneath the indispensable poetry; and this can only make\\nfor convergence of the several great religions on certain\\ncommon essentials. The problem of religious knowledge,\\nsharpened by the universal acute self-consciousness of sci-\\nentific method, compels a community even of language in\\nthe defense of any faith whatever. The mystic everywhere\\nmust now whereon he stands.\\n\\nIn this common emergency—for such it is—there is but\\none of the great religions whose history has driven it to an\\napproximate maturity. There is but one that has been com-\\npelled to come to terms with a nationally convincing and\\ntechnically triumphant naturalism, with the mind-body\\nrealism from which modernity springs, with a psychology\\nof great prowess, value, and depth which can implicitly\\npresent a human nature devoid of freedom in plausible de-\\nfiance of what everyone knows, with a social science whose\\nstrong and valid sense of relativity is prepared to sweep\\naway every absolute as mischievous arrogance, including\\nthose absolutes on which its own judgments of relativity\\nmust be based. I will not say that Christianity is unitedly\\nequipped with the answers. I will say that the answers are\\nat hand within its immediate context and are being recog-\\nnized. And it becomes, therefore, the opportunity—not\\nthe boast—of Christianity to lend its maturity to all reli-\\ngions.\\n\\nThis unique position of Christianity, which it would be\\n162 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nunjust to attribute solely to accidents of its history, since\\nthat history of encounter with well-armed critics is largely\\nof its own breeding, will not be unfelt by alert minds among\\nOriental youth. It will result, in those objective enough to\\ndistinguish the religion from its associations with political\\nwesternisms substantially outgrown, in a new consideration\\nof Christianity as of a needed source of strength, such as\\nwe have noted above on the part of certain Japanese\\nthinkers (p. 120). Indeed, in so far as the world faith for\\nthe arriving civilization must be a mature faith, finding its\\nway to a natural union of the natural and the super-\\nnatural, it is possible to say that this religion under what-\\never name will necessarily be in substance Christian.\\n\\nvi. Long-range Considerations:\\nSpiritual Iron; Auspicious Fanaticism\\n\\nBur maturity is not the sole long-distance considera-\\ntion. There is an equally permanent necessity for what I\\nwill call spiritual iron, with which maturity by itself is not\\nnecessarily in harmony. Here Christianity, in its modern\\nphase, has something to learn not alone from the con-\\ntemporary, but also from the more ancient East. For there\\nis a certain danger that the Orient, under the pressure of\\nswiftly growing hopes and the labors of social reconstruc-\\ntion, may loosen its hold on its own unique ancient sources\\nof strength.\\n\\nWhere can we find today that incomparable continuity\\nof high discipline and mental prowess that could transmit\\nmemoriter a vast tradition as this has been done in India?\\nThe arrival of a “New Dispensation” has always been a\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 163\\n\\nsignal for dissolving former observances and types of\\ntraining ; and they are often due for dissolving, but not for\\nthe dismissal of their intensity of commitment and energy\\nof aspiration. There remains in the East a distinctive\\nmoral virility of which all religion has persistent need,\\nparticularly a religion which, like much current Christian-\\nity, tends to regard itself as a fortunately conceived syn-\\nthesis of both worlds. For current Christianity, precisely\\nthrough its growing capacity to bring nature and super-\\nnature together into organic union—well cured of rigors\\nformerly inspired by fears of Hell, and equally unenticed\\nby such images as those of Dante’s or Milton’s Paradise—\\ntends to find in its sagacious synthesis, not that nature is\\nlifted up but that supernature is reduced to a humanistic\\n\\n. affix of nature. Prior to the present era of possible human\\nself-destruction on a world scale, with its abrupt demand\\nfor literal truth-facing, there had entered a certain com-\\nplacency into the Christian outlook. This complacency\\nwas ready to translate sin as an indisposition open to\\npsychiatric treatment, to regard the Cross as an outgrown\\nmedieval emblem, to consider human suffering as the un-\\nfinished business of applied science, and, except for a few\\nheroic spirits, too spiritually and mentally weary to assume\\nthe growing burden of a technically competent world’s\\nunderlying doubt and despair.\\n\\nThis same Christianity which once gave the western\\nworld a revolutionary concept, the right of the responsible\\nindividual against the state, and fought for it,’ seems as\\na body too flabby to protest when that priceless treasure\\nis transmuted into an unconditional birthday present for\\n\\n15 Cf, Tertullian’s fearless assertion of the right to choose one’s own\\nreligion,\\n164 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\neach sentient seeker of his personal happiness. The will to\\ncreate through suffering is damped down into the will to\\nhave a costless comfort.\\n\\nThere is no costless comfort to be had in this world,\\nstill less a costless joy. For there is no satisfaction of the\\nwill apart from work done—in the end, of taking a share\\nin world-making, whether as farmer or mechanic, as home-\\nmaker or law-maker. . . . No artist can make without\\ntravail an honest report of what soul he finds in things,\\nNot even love can come to its own without pain; for loving\\nor being loved is no right already paid for by existent\\nmerit or beauty; it is a glory undeserved, unseekable, and\\ncalling for life service. And wherever love is made cheap,\\nthere is the cheapness of a civilization’s soul. If the East\\nhas needed the technical steel of the West, the West needs\\nthe spiritual iron of the East. For the East has never for-\\ngotten that there are conditions for our good, a moral law\\nat the heart of the universe, even when conceived under\\nthe forbidding and imperfect guise of Karma.\\n\\nWe have been too easily satisfied to say that Christianity\\nis the religion of love, without noting that the love of God\\ntoward man can be no regime of moral ease. If, as Buddha\\nmay have suspected, the unbending impersonality of the\\norder of nature is the reliable imprint of an infinite care,**\\nthe converse is also true. Love—always more than law—\\nmust still speak through law,’ the divine personality\\n\\n16 Whitehead suggests (Science and the Modern World, pp. 40f.) that\\nthe Christian conception of a detailed special Providence is a prelude to\\nthe modern conception of a minutely calculable physical law.\\n\\n17 My booklet, Science and the Idea of God, is essentially an essay on\\nnonphysical law in the structure of experience. The religion of Buddha,\\noften described as godless, has as its basis what Fichte—also accused of\\natheism—called the moral order of the universe. It would be more\\n\\naccurate to say that Buddhism resolves God as Being into God as\\nProcess, responsive to moral distinctions.\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 165\\n\\nthrough impersonality over vast regions of its undeviating\\nsolicitude.\\n\\nArnold Toynbee calls the Christianity of today to\\n“repentance” for its presumed monopoly of God’s grace.\\nLet me put it thus: our Christianity is in need of recon-\\nception through a deeper and humbler intercourse with\\nthe soul of the East, in its agelong acceptance of a search-\\ning self-discipline.\\n\\nThis call to learn from the East will be taking us nearer\\nto the spirit of an earlier Christianity! There is no\\nstronger endorsement of the lasting significance of the\\nmessage emanating from Galilee than the fact that in\\nmoving forward past modernity we arrive at a better\\ncomprehension of its changeless demands. For the claims\\nof the absolute and the perfect are not afflicted with age.\\nIn this sense it can be said that wherever man journeys,\\nChrist as the voice of the absolute has been there before\\nhim! Fanaticism, if we distinguish between its types, has a\\npermanent role in the world: in one type, the ruthless\\ninhumanity of a Hitler; in another, the startling certitude\\nof a Schweitzer rooted in a clear recognition of the claim of\\nan “impossible” standard, first made articulate two thou-\\nsand years ago. In this sense, the fanaticism of Christ is\\nthe perpetuity of his pertinence. The Orient has continued\\nto understand this aspect of his teaching better than we.\\n\\nLet us carry a step farther this meditation on fanati-\\ncism.7®\\n\\n18 “Fanaticism” as a word which has lost caste may be beyond rescue.\\nBut it is fair to remember that the Latin fanaticus is simply the person\\nwho, in the spiritual atmosphere of the fanwm, the temple, has become\\ndivinely inspired. The sacred madness shades into the unthinking rigidity\\nand then into “possession” by the demon, which now usurps the name of\\nfanaticism.\\n166 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nWhat has chiefly stood in the way of the message of the\\nNazarene in the Orient has been less the political and\\neconomic tempers of imperialism which have often accom-\\npanied its course, than a certain lack of contrition on the\\npart of many of its messengers. For Christianity is not\\nsomething we have, and can therefore transmit: it is some-\\nthing we have continually to seek, knowing that it is\\nforever beyond us.\\n\\nThis lack of contrition is likely to result from a loss of\\nthe vision of an absolute demand, on the ground of a\\nprudent perception that the absolute cannot be attained.\\nTo reduce one’s aim to the dimension of the attainable is\\nsurely a counsel of good sense, perhaps of morality itself,\\nif one would escape the condemnation of pursuing utopias,\\nor of “idealism” as the crowning vice of dreamers from\\nPlato onward. But the logic of the case, which is also its\\nmorality, is simple: if the standard which reports the true\\nmeasure of our performance is not held in its full simplic-\\nity and force, the result will be the replacement of the true\\nstandard with something “fairly good.” This is the new\\nidolatry of which we have spoken, superseding the ancient\\nidolatry of the image, willing like its ancestor to make a\\ngod of the best it has so far achieved. Thus our mastery of\\nnature—surely God’s will for man—our conquests of dis-\\nease, of poverty, misery, ignorance, all these and other\\ntriumphs, tend to mount the stage one by one as The Good,\\nrather than as the conditional goods they are, within the\\nframe of the simple but unyielding requirement of the\\nperfect-in-heart, without which they, too, contain the seeds\\nof corruption.\\n\\nIt is part of the strange shallowness of recent western\\nlife that it should be deemed a conceit to recognize an\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 167\\n\\nabsolute, and a humility to consider all standards relative,\\nwhereas it is precisely the reverse: it is only the absolute\\nthat duly rebukes our pride. And only a religion setting an\\nabsolute standard for the heart as well as for the will can\\ncarry the permanent cure for spiritual arrogance, while\\nremaining—at whatever stage of our moral journey—still\\nin advance. That religion, again under whatever name, is\\nin its nature the Only Way.\\n\\nReinhold Niebuhr represents for our time the intense\\nactuality of this dilemma. It is necessary, as he has so\\neffectively shown, to see Christianity as pertinent to exist-\\ning issues, and to recognize the inescapable sharing in the\\ncorporate guilt of every participant in community action.\\nThe possibilities, in modern society, of any incorporation\\nof a clear ideal diminish; and as Hegel pointed out in his\\nintroduction to Philosophie des Rechts, the man who holds\\nhimself aloof from association with the imperfect not alone\\nisolates himself, but plays the part of the destroyer. This\\nalmost axiomatic consideration tends to round off the prac-\\ntical maxims of the “good citizen” until, as the good-\\nenough citizen, he loses his cutting edge. Holding to the\\ngreat virtue of compromise, he becomes incapable of a\\ncreative fanaticism. He may become the notable civil serv-\\nant, administrator, party leader; but he cannot reach—\\nperhaps not understand—the sources of power in a\\nSchweitzer or a Gandhi. He may become a Lord Lloyd, but\\nnever a Lord Irwin. I am prepared to say that the man of\\nsense and conscience must always recognize the achievable,\\nand work for it, but at the same time never confuse it with\\nthe morally requisite; he must keep both in view, as the\\nmarksman must see his target and at the same time allow\\nfor the drop of his bullet. In this sense, Christianity is\\n168 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ndefinable as a creative fanaticism, based on its prophecy\\nof the victorious power of forceless good will. To discount\\nits idealism is to destroy its essence.\\n\\nvii. The Goal of Confluence and the Ultimate Name\\n\\nNurrurr of these two long-range demands upon the\\nfuture world religion—neither maturity nor an inspired\\nradicalism—is likely to be borrowed or transferred from\\nreligion to religion. Both represent qualities which the\\nreligious sense of mankind will increasingly crave in its\\nhistoric faiths, and which will be absorbed degree by\\ndegree as these faiths interact with the ripening insights\\nof their own communicants. The spiritual iron of the East,\\nas a nonlocal factor of human dignity, never complete,\\nwill be likely to come by way of periods of public crisis,\\nbringing revulsion against the self-satisfied urbanities of\\npolite religion, and a thirst for that natural greatness—\\nthe special province of religion—for which first things are\\nput first, as in the days when the blood of martyrs was\\nindeed the seed of the church, and the salt of the earth had\\nnot lost its savor.\\n\\nThese processes will therefore promote the silent rap-\\nprochement of the great faiths, without canceling the\\ndifferences in historic rootage. The Christian will not be\\nconcerned that the total outlook slowly emerging bear his\\nname. He will be mindful that his Master in one parable\\nlikened the kingdom of God to leaven which a woman took\\nand hid in three measures of meal till the whole was\\nleavened—the hidden anonymity a favorable condition for\\nits work. The time is ripe for that radical reconception of\\nwhich we have spoken, whereby the concept of the Christ\\nis extended to include that unbound Spirit who stands and\\nINTERACTION AMONG UNIVERSAL RELIGIONS 169\\n\\nhas stood at the door of every man, and who, in various\\nguises, still appears to him who opens, both as an imper-\\nsonal word and as a personal presence. As such a presence,\\nhe relieves at a stroke that sense of the measureless vast-\\nness of the world in which the individual soul finds itself a\\nnegligible atom, hopelessly lost. It is this, intrinsically\\nincredible, personal address of the immensities of the\\ncosmos and of history—the necessary and sufficient answer\\nto the quantitative revelations of astrophysics **—which,\\nI surmise, will tend to identify the resulting world faith.\\n\\nBut the specific name will not be insisted upon, it will be\\nchosen. This reconception would involve putting away an\\ninherently noble but limiting type of Only-Way Christian-\\nity whose impulse to spread the faith has been less the joy\\nof good tidings than the rescue motive, hoping to avert a\\nprospect of damnation hanging over the souls of those\\nunredeemed by a personal disclosure of the strait gate and\\nnarrow way. When we put away the essentially supersti-\\ntious idea that there is one official divine-human adminis-\\ntration of the entrance into life, open to variation by plea,\\nperformance, or penance, rather than in the inherent\\narduousness of the conditions of human release into peace\\nand greatness, the traditional Only-Way must yield to the\\nWay which alone defines those conditions with truth and\\njustice.*° In such yielding, Christianity as an organization\\nwould lose a motive for propaganda based on special access\\nto the “keys,” but it would realize a far more convincing\\nuniversality based on an application to itself of its own\\nmaxim, “He that loseth his life for my sake, the same shall\\nfind it.”\\n\\n10 Science and the Idea of God, 112 #.\\n\\n2° Perhaps implied in Radhakrishnan’s remark: “The distressing fea-\\nture of our age is not its atheism but its belief, the strange forms of\\nsuperstition which it is willing to adopt.” Recovery of Faith, 1955.\\n170 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nRetaining the symbols of their historic pieties, the great\\nfaiths will grow in their awareness of a unity more sig-\\nnificant than the remaining differences. As an ancient\\nHindu tradition runs, the place of junction of rivers has a\\npeculiar sanctity, because each of the streams then realizes\\nits full being. But if Jumna and Ganges run together,\\nshall the united lower stream be called Ganges or Jumna?\\nIs it neither? Is it both? Or is it that one whose symbol\\nmen freely find compacted with the sense of both, holding\\nin a historic life and deed, for which there can be no repeti-\\ntion and no substitute, a prophetic answer to man’s\\neternal need?\\nSTUDY VI\\n\\nNEWER VISTAS OF\\nTHOUGHT AND\\nACTION\\n\\ni. Necessity and Difficulty of Forecast:\\nIts One Firm Ground\\n\\nFarrurer than any other creature, man lives in the\\nfuture; the effectiveness of his living depends on the\\nsagacity of his forecast. He cannot evade the function of\\nprophecy.\\n\\nYet the foreseeing of human affairs becomes increas-\\ningly hazardous. Laws of nature that support prediction\\nin physics here lose footing, not because there is no “hu-\\nman nature” to count on, but because with an endless\\nelaboration of new motive patterns and a limitless novelty\\nof imagination there goes an increasing range of power\\nsubject to man’s discretion. Forecast must always bear the\\ncondition “other things being equal,” and with the one\\ncertainty that other things will not be equal.\\n\\nIn the broad sweep, the lines of “social evolution” lose\\ntheir clarity. The eighteenth-century assurance of\\nprogress with “enlightenment” has faded—not into noth-\\n\\n11\\n172 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ning as those would hold who have progressed beyond\\n“progress”—but to a thin hope: we still endeavor to edu-\\ncate our young! There is no law that can chart the curve\\nof social change; and on the whole we cherish our unpre-\\ndictability! We listen respectfully to the prophets of\\nUntergang, with the reserved expectation that they will\\nGo Under first. And as for the rhythm of rise-and-decay\\nof civilizations—that stirring picture based on the valid\\nprinciple that civilization generates its own poisons is\\ncrossed, as we have seen, by the rising level of the “unlos-\\nables.” It is a refreshing change from the cult of all-\\nchange to consider that some human achievements stay\\nachieved, though their significance is continually revised\\nby the emergence of novelty around them.\\n\\nHegel’s dialectic picture of history as the March of the\\nIdea through the world holds up rather better than\\nHerbert Spencer’s deduction that an industrial age must\\nsucceed the military, and usher in peace and a tolerable\\nproportion of altruism. But Hegel was too wise to let his\\ndialectical train run to its final bumper in a German sta-\\ntion—as he has been accused of doing—and stop there\\n\\n\\' forever; history, he judged, must move westward, and he\\nknew that Berlin was not the farthest west—there was still\\nAmerica! More seriously, he knew that the Idea does not\\nstop; and he was too well aware of the infinite unfolding of\\nthought to use his dialectic as a frame for prophecy. He\\nknew the disturbing law of the supersession of truth by\\ntruth; what we have once mastered and identified with our-\\nselves—that we have already outpassed. Just as a psychol-\\nogist who has found a “law” of human nature, and im-\\nprudently lets mankind know what it is, has created a\\nmotive for defeating that particular law (tell me what my\\n“reactions” are, and I will give you a new one!), so an age\\nNEWER VISTAS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION 173\\n\\nwhich should become possessed of a complete forward-look-\\ning self-consciousness would proceed to annul its validity.\\nNeither individual man, nor man in community, will sub-\\nmit to be deprived of his realm of improvisation and crea-\\ntive prowess, This is perhaps the only “law of history”\\nthat has no exception.\\n\\nThere is, however, one ground of prophecy which con-\\ntinues to hold good: the wnreal must yield to the real.\\nTruth may be displaced by better truth, but never by non-\\ntruth: humanity can never give up nor go backward in its\\npursuit of truth at various levels. And we have fairly\\nlearned the lesson that scientific truth is not the whole of\\ntruth; this is a welcome lesson for scientists, who can no\\nlonger bear the sole responsibility for the survival of civi-\\nlization: the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is their fervid\\ningemination of a wider citizenship. It is the quest of\\n“reality” in which man is unreservedly engaged. Admit\\nthe multiguity of the term “reality,” the principle still has\\na tangible meaning that the “real” will prevail over the\\nsham. Whatever man or civilization parts company with\\nthe underlying verities of existence seals its own fate;\\nwhatever builds on them is secure, This was Carlyle’s prin-\\nciple of forecast; he sounded the doom of shams, and we\\nmay extend his principle to whatever is specious and illu-\\nsory, to the cultivation of false emotions, false arts, and\\nfalse reputes, as of false securities, to the whole fabric of a\\nculture blown up by the techniques of a venal publicity.\\nThe “Real” remains in some sense a sphinx riddle; yet we\\nknow the man and the society that sees straight and has\\npaid in pain the price of veracity and justice. And we know\\nthe deviations from this difficult and rare realism (a real-\\nism identical with no philosophical school, but the animus of\\nall philosophy )—on one hand the superstitions of hopeful\\n174 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nfancy and on the other superstitions of dogmatic negation\\nfor which all faith is self-deceit, and all kindness hy-\\npocrisy.\\n\\nIn brief, a valid prophecy depends on a valid meta-\\nphysic. And while a valid metaphysic is said to be hard to\\narrive at, there is a chance that the principle of the\\nprophet of Galilee who staked his whole career on the fore-\\ncast that “the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of\\nmustard seed,” and that in this kingdom “the weak things”\\nare destined “to confound the mighty,” may have its\\nfoundation in the real. The empirical mystic may be the\\nmost genuine realist.\\n\\nii. Decline of Superstition, Religious and Naturalist\\n\\nI vivp myself hopeful for the present and oncoming era\\nof mankind, because I find this kind of metaphysic in\\nprocess of growth, and the two varieties of superstition in\\nprocess of rapid decline. As the scientific spirit makes its\\nsteady march, there is little need to quarrel one by one with\\nthe aberrations of religious imagination; no need to list\\nexpressly what one does not believe as to the miraculous\\ncertification of divine missions. The sap of credulity ceases\\nto run, and the unfruitful fancies flutter to earth “like\\ndead leaves,” while their poetic souls rise to the treasure\\nland of enduring myth. At the same time I find a note-\\nworthy decrease in the opposing type of superstition, the\\ndogmatic negations of a supposedly scientific world view.\\nThrough the wide growth of logical sensitivity, the convic-\\ntion that “nature is real” is far less commonly identified\\nwith the non sequitur that “nothing is real but nature.”\\nWhile materialism as a phase of political ideology is more\\nwidely professed than ever before, and our humanistic\\nNEWER VISTAS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION 175\\n\\nculture claims its liberty not as a will to believe but as a\\nright to disbelieve, to be secularist, there is far less disposi-\\ntion to dismiss religion out of hand as a passing illusion.\\nWe have become justly chary of universal negatives.\\n\\nThe “naturalism” of today, strong in manifestos, treads\\ncarefully. In its wider-drawn “nature” it includes much\\nof the beyond-nature of yesterday. It tends to consider\\nevolution, not as a “nothing-but” primeval stuff trans-\\nformed, but as an “emergence” of the undeducible: emerg-\\nence could be defined as a stepwise domestication of what,\\nin terms of the previous stage, is strictly supernatural.\\n(I could ease the assertion a little by using the word\\n“transcendence”; but the principle is the same!) It does\\nnot firmly shut the door on “freedom,” if it is allowed to\\ndefine the term. But chiefly, it agrees in the main to reject\\nwhat Whitehead calls the “bifurcation of nature.” It\\ninclines to include the qualities of the world as an integral\\npart of the total fact of “nature.” This is tantamount to\\na new naturalism, agreeing that the night view is incom-\\nplete—in short, abstract; that nature is the union of\\nprimary with secondary, and perhaps tertiary, qualities,\\na vast and welcome advance in the establishment of a com-\\nmon philosophical groundwork.\\n\\nBut with the qualities, there enters into the criterion of\\nthe “real” a new factor of immense import, not yet fully\\naccepted, but unbanishable—an aesthetic factor. This\\ncalls for special note.\\n\\nui. Aesthetic Factor in Experience as Cognitive\\nScrencr and philosophy alike must have their empirical\\n\\nfoundations. The empiricism of the seventeenth century\\nfelt bound to exclude feeling in order to be mathematically\\n176 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nobjective; the empiricism of the twentieth century, while\\nmaintaining the clean objectivity of the equationable\\nworld, finds it must include feeling in order to be conerete\\nin other phases of its world.\\n\\n“Experience,” once considered as a process of sense\\nawareness, is now recognized as a process of awareness of\\nthe real, not in spite of its inescapable feeling-component\\nbut because of it! Experience is passion-laden, and the\\npassion in it is not without pertinence to the nature of the\\nworld it reports. This passion may be considered a purely\\nsubjective reaction to an impassive reality. It need not\\nbe so considered. Entertain for a moment the hypothesis\\nthat the passion of human experience is not reaction alone\\nbut response, and therefore an enlargement of our em-\\npirical veracity. I am prepared to say that the experience\\nof beauty, of awe (and it is not insignificant that for\\nEmily Dickinson, the experience of beauty in nature was\\nattended with what she called “awe,” including a demand\\nfor her activity as interpreter‘), like love itself, has an\\nontological aspect. The transformation of Eros, in Plato’s\\nview, was a movement toward reality; we begin to see the\\nvalidity of that view.\\n\\nThis conception is strangely echoed in a fancy of\\nFreud’s later years that his “reality principle” could lead\\nto a nonrepressive social order. Herbert Marcuse rejecting\\nthis dream (Eros and Civilization) proposes that the\\naesthetic norm may enter, between sensuousness and\\nmorality, as a guide to a free reconciliation of man and\\nnature. I cannot join in the dream either of Freud or of\\nMarcuse that a nonrepressive social order—if that means\\na nondisciplinary order—is either achievable or desirable.\\n\\nThomas H. Johnson, Hmily Dickinson, an Interpretive Biography,\\n135.\\nNEWER VISTAS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION 1g\\n\\nHere Plato, as in most matters, stands as the corrective to\\nthe Freudian ideal of relaxation or of costless normality.\\nBut I endorse the broad principle here coming to evidence,\\nof an aesthetic norm which shall be, as for Schelling, an\\n“organon” of the metaphysical real.\\n\\nHitherto, aesthetic judgments have been admitted into\\nour ontology only by the side entrances of metaphor and\\nsymbol, while their products in poetry and art, including\\nmyth, have been considered rather as ontological play or\\nquestion or at most hypothesis, not as assertion; but even\\nas such, with an implied claim of relevance.\\n\\nIt is an important step in the interpretation of religion\\nto accept this minimal claim. It places the “superstitions”\\nof religion at once upon a plane higher than that of mere\\naberration. The very infinitude of art serves to illuminate\\nthe relations of the religions; for it implies a limitless\\nvariety in the expressive resources of religion, without\\nimplying confusion in its basic world view. The pertinence\\nof the aesthetic factor, understood as explorative, becomes\\na path of mutual understanding rather than of discord\\namong religions; for religion, which is the passion of\\nliving, must have both its identity and its variety. And it\\nbecomes a function of philosophy to find the literal basis\\nof this unity in variety, at the point where feeling becomes\\nontological.\\n\\nThe function of philosophy in the future relations of\\nreligions thus acquires a more central vitality.\\n\\nThe first tendency of philosophy, as of science, is\\nnaturally enough to dwell on thought rather than feeling,\\nto look for the general idea within the specific cult. It seeks\\nin the several religions what is common to all, the uni-\\nversal within the field of faith. It proposes to relieve the\\n178 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ncontentions of differing dogmas by discerning a Common\\nDenominator. And this is indeed an indispensable service,\\nan inductive effort resulting not alone in discovered agree-\\nment but also in simplification, and simplification is a need\\nincreasing with the intricacy of modern types of civiliza-\\ntion.\\n\\nIn this respect, the services of Vedanta have been out-\\nstanding, especially in its more recent developments as\\ninterpreted by the Belur Math, the Ramakrishna center\\nnear Calcutta, which transplated into many western\\ncenters finds itself speaking easily in terms of western\\nexperience. This “Western Vedanta”* proclaims that\\n“authentic mystics of all religions are talking about the\\nsame Truth, and that the central Reality can be ap-\\nproached from many different standpoints”; further that\\n“this emphasis upon the common points of all religions,\\nnot their differences, makes an appeal to the liberal man\\nof the modern day.” * It moves toward what Radhakrish-\\nnan describes as a “rational faith which does not mock the\\nfree spirit of man, a new vision of God.” *\\n\\nBut to a large extent this Western Vedanta has escaped\\nthe tendency of the philosophical generalizer to concen-\\ntrate exclusively on the intellectual elements of religion,\\nlighting on a few staples of doctrine—say God, Freedom,\\nDestiny—omitting too much, passing lightly over ele-\\nments of feeling and observance. Vedanta concerns itself\\nwith the One, but also with purpose, passion, and the quest\\nof peace. Our present era in philosophy has also seen more\\n\\n*Gerald Heard in Prabuddha Bharata, Jan., 1950, says that “a new\\nthing has come into history—that is Western Vedanta... a living\\nreligion and not an academic study.”\\n\\n*From Vedanta and the West by the Vedanta Society of Southern\\n\\nCalifornia,\\n+ Recovery of Faith, 1955.\\nNEWER VISTAS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION 179\\n\\ndeeply.

Philosophic Advance from General to Particular:\\nIncarnation\\n\\nBur so long as it remains in the general, even in the\\ngeneralities of feeling and observance, philosophy has not\\nyet done its chief service to the religion of the future. For\\nreligion has a special concern with the circumstance that\\nour actual world is a particular world, and a world of par-\\nticulars; and that the roots of feeling are there.\\n\\nIt is tempting, but not accurate, to say that nothing but\\nparticulars exists; not accurate, because particulars give\\nexistence to the generals they embody. But without par-\\nticular being, nothing exists. It is a striking merit of the\\npresent age in philosophy that we feel once more the\\n180 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsignificance of plain existence; of being, in its measureless\\ndifference from nonbeing. And religion is uniquely occu-\\npied with this difference: it raises the question whether\\n“God” may be precisely this, the ingredient of being in all\\nbeings, the “I am.”\\n\\nAnd if so, what of one’s own existence? Do I exist only\\nin the prior existence of God? Am I wholly dependent and\\ncreated in my particular selfhood? Or have I, though a\\ncreature, still the power to create? For without that power,\\nwhat worth can my individual existence have? These are\\nthe basic issues of life, of the meaning of life, of religion.\\n\\nAnd if this is the case, is it not essential to religion to\\ncome to the particular, to the destiny of this particular\\nstream of being on this petty planet, yes, to the thoughts,\\ndeeds, fortunes, of the individual souls therein engaged?\\nOtherwise, what is prayer and what the fate of the per-\\nsonal soul? If God is only the Universal and Infinite, does\\nhe not become negligible to the negligible, to the personal\\natom lost in measureless expanse and time? Religion must\\nsomehow present itself as the personal intimacy of the\\nWhole to the Infinitesimal, as an inversion both of the\\nphysical and of the conceptual perspectives, an inversion\\nadumbrated by Cusanus in his strange doctrine of the\\ncoincidence of opposites, the greatest expressing itself in\\nthe least. In brief, it belongs to the general essence of all\\nreligion that at some point it escapes generality, clothes\\nitself in particulars, descends to the shaping of personal\\ndeeds and hopes, becomes “a” religion.\\n\\nIf our philosophy cannot interpret this step, it fails the\\nfuture at a decisive point.\\n\\nTheology in various religions has, of course, long since\\nfound its way to this point. The doctrine of Incarnation\\nNEWER VISTAS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION 181\\n\\ncould be defined as a generality whose role it is to escape\\nfrom generality, accepting the responsibility of the uni-\\nversal for realization in the particular. The doctrine of\\nCreation shares this responsibility: it represents the par-\\nticular universe as a result of decision, a passage from idea\\nto fact. Though the phrase “the best of all possible\\nworlds” is now recognized, in the logic of infinite collec-\\ntions, as unmeaning,® what is created must in some sense\\nembody a purpose, And while quite literally every decision\\nis an incarnation, clothing an ideal desideratum in (partly\\nirrelevant) factuality, the doctrine of Incarnation goes\\nfarther: it proposes that the One-and-Real can become\\nand has become recognizably and personally present in\\nparticular human form or forms.\\n\\nIt is indeed this doctrine which most sharply divides the\\nexisting great religions, and which is least amenable to the\\nassimilating tendencies we have considered. These religions\\nseparate not simply on the ground of a postulate of divine\\ndignity: God “neither begets nor is begotten.” They\\nseparate on the line of patent inconsistency: the Ineffable\\nby definition cannot become visible and tangible; the\\nEternal cannot limit itself to a career in space and time.\\nThere can be prophets or a Prophet; there can be messiahs\\nor a Messiah; there can be logoi or a Logos: but God-in-\\nhuman-form, it is judged, must remain in the realm of\\nfable. .\\n\\nThere are suggestions for a solution of this dilemma in\\nIndian speculations, having in the background their own\\ntraditions of the avatars of divine personages—specula-\\ntions which culminate in the philosophy of Sankara and\\nthe contemporary Vedanta. In the conception of the\\nworld’s ultimate and absolute unity, with its corollary of\\n\\n5“Fact and Destiny,” The Review of Metaphysics, March, 1951, 381 ff.\\n182 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe unreality of individual distinctions, the identity of\\neach soul with the One implies that in their true essence all\\nmen are divine. “Vedanta affirms that in his real nature\\nevery person is divine, and that happiness and genuine\\nself-expression can be gained to the extent that, through\\nlove for God and neighbor, he permits this divinity to be\\nmanifested.” ®\\n\\nHere the language of Vedanta allows itself a certain\\nassimilation to western tradition; but through it we recog-\\nnize a specific answer to the central issue of all metaphysics\\n—the unity or plurality of the world, the nature of being,\\nthe meaning of individuality. Here Vedanta approaches\\ntangency to Royce’s profound doctrine of the one Individ-\\nual from whose will all individuality proceeds. But where\\nall are divine, we seem to have returned to the general;\\nand the embodiment of the One in the many remains af-\\nfected by the unreality of the many, together with that of\\nthe empirical universe and its historical process.\\n\\nThe present stage of philosophical inquiry provides cer-\\ntain new vistas which may lead to the resolution of this\\nimpasse.\\n\\nIt does so by way of a clearer understanding of selfhood\\nin its relation to other self and to the world; a clearer\\nunderstanding of that intersubjectivity whereby each in-\\ndividual in his solitude is nevertheless a participant in the\\nuniversality of his world, of its essence and its standards.\\nThe individual is not per se “divine”; he participates in\\nthe divine nature, but the degree of his participation is a\\nfunction of his liberty. He has the choice of acting as ego\\natom or as contributing partner of the divine purpose.\\nHuman individuality, while sharing in the absolute Being,\\n\\n® Vedanta and the West.\\nNEWER VISTAS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION 183\\n\\nand participating in the absoluteness of that Being’s\\njudgments of the actual—the universally true or false, the\\nuniversally good or evil—has the double possibility of\\nmaking itself solitary, monadic, mortal, or enjoying the\\nfreedom of sharing in the world purpose of the One. In the\\npresence of the universal Thou-art, there is an immediate\\nsummons to live by objective thought (including science)\\nand by creative action: and in so far as the individual\\nresponds, partially or completely, to this imperative, God\\nis literally, through him, at work in history.\\n\\nThrough this vista of free participation,’ the scruples\\nof Judaism and Islam to accept a doctrine of Incarnation,\\nwhich in view of the history of doctrine have genuine\\ngrounds, can cease to be barriers of separation.

The\\nquestion, What is he? has to be answered, He is both; both\\nhis actual and his possible self. Or more accurately, He is\\nmany; for his possibilities are many, for better and for\\nworse. How, then, is he to be treated “as what he is”?\\n\\n7 Human Nature and Its Remaking, ch, XIV.\\n184 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nTo “love one’s neighbor” would be to deal with him, not\\nblindly but with responsible provocation, on the basis of\\nhis favorable possibilities as creatively discerned by you,\\nincluding therein that not actual but potential divinity\\nwhich your deed may elicit.

On this conception, the religions may,\\nand will, ultimately unite.\\nEPILOGUE\\n\\nWirx the relations between religions thus relieved of con-\\nfusion, at once by the growing unity of their unlosable\\nessences, the understanding acceptance of variety, and the\\nquiet convergence of purpose in the identity of a historic\\ntask, religion will be able to bring a new vitality into the\\ndisturbed motivations of mankind.\\n\\nIt will summon man to give himself to his science with-\\nout reserve and without despair, knowing that the purpose\\nof science cannot involve the banishing of purpose from\\nthe cosmos, and that the empiricism of sense data is but a\\nlimiting edge of the widening empiricism of the ontological\\npassions, including those of the lover, the artist, and the\\nprophet, which open the door to reality.\\n\\nIt will sustain that integrity of volition which the state\\nmust assume and cannot by itself command. Each individ-\\nual person, being summoned to find in the apparent dis-\\norder of human history a telos with which he can co-\\noperate, and in so doing to find the worth of his own\\nexistence, will discover in his will-to-participate in a world\\ntask a nonpolitical basis for those legal rights which, taken\\nas costless gifts of nature, work for the corruption of the\\npolitical community.\\n\\nIt will uphold the dignity of the individual human being\\nby upholding his responsibility. For it will leave in his\\nhand the freedom to respond or not to respond to the call\\nto co-operate with the divine purpose. This unique trust of\\nfreedom, vested in no other creature, marks both his nobil-\\nity and his peril, his fitness to maintain and his capacity\\nto destroy the oncoming civilization. It will assure the\\nindividual that his use of this freedom, his disposition of\\n\\n185\\n186 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhis own solitude, is the instant concern of the center of all\\nBeing.\\n\\nIt will also assure him that the way of his duty is at the\\nsame time the way of such happiness as can come from\\nloving and being loved, from the full employment of one’s\\npowers, and from an inner peace. But it will deal with him\\non the basis of a profound honor: it will promise him no\\nescape from pain and ill fortune; it will offer him the Cross\\n—his own. Its way to happiness is the path of a will to\\ncreate in love, which is inseparable from a will to create\\nthrough suffering. But that will, like love itself, is touched\\nwith the light of immortality.\\n\\nSo far as this stern and undeluded but life-affirming will\\nprevails among a people, the state will recover those neces-\\nsary powers which in.our opening study we saw slipping\\nfrom its grasp—among them its power to educate, and\\nalso to punish.

A Conversation. By Henry Nelson Wie-\\nman, Douglas Clyde Macintosh and Max Carl Otto.\\n\\nThe existence of God is not an academic question: it is less\\nso today than at any time we can think of. To more people\\nthan ever before, the whole problem of religion turns on this\\none question. And to most of these people, the question appears\\nto be of the first order of seriousness, in the sense that it makes\\na momentous difference which way the answer falls.\\n\\nBut what difference does it make? It should be easy to say,\\nif the question is indeed so vital. Yet it is not wholly easy; for\\nthere is a difference between what anyone thinks God is, and\\nwhat God means to him. Many people of our generation have\\nquietly dropped God out of their lives—quietly but deliber-\\nately—and find they get on as well as before, perhaps better.\\nGod had “existed” for them; but he had not “meant” anything\\nin particular: as a visitor with no special errand, he could go,\\nand leave only a sense of relief. It is just this consciously\\nexperimental, and apparently successful, godlessness—char-\\nacteristic of our time—on the part of many persons of high\\ncharacter, and of at least one great state—that makes the ques-\\ntion terribly imminent to so many others. The biographical\\narguments outweigh the philosophic.\\n\\nLet us find our issue, then, in this way: If there is no God,\\nAPPENDIX 191\\n\\nsomething surely is gone out of the world which we used to\\nthink was there. What is it that is gone?\\n\\nFor some, it is a great thing, but far off—a sort of super-\\nvision of the universe that never comes close home. To believe\\nin God, for such persons, means chiefly a sense that the total\\ndrift of things is being looked after, as by a competent and\\ntrustworthy overseer, who really knows more about it than we\\ndo and who has the fundamental interests of mankind at heart;\\nso that one is free to concentrate on human business, without\\nuseless worry over the cosmos, It is interesting that this free-\\ndom of mind to be whole-heartedly human, assuming all the\\nresponsibilities one can do anything about, is very much the\\neffect that Mr. Otto desires to achieve by getting rid of God!\\nFor the persons we are now speaking of, the loss of God would\\nleave them ill at ease about the framework of human life; a\\nvast responsibility would have fallen on them which they can\\nneither shake off nor discharge. They could school themselves\\nto forget it and be all the more neighborly the while. But they\\nwould secretly know that we human beings are cultivating a\\ngarden in the midst of a desert which in all likelihood will\\neventually cover both garden and gardeners; while it, the\\ndesert, will never know what it has done. We shall do our best\\nwhile we are here together—that is not futile; it is only that\\nthe name of the whole picture is Futility. That, I think, is a\\nreal difference.\\n\\nTo others the loss of God would mean the loss of something\\nvery intimate, William James once tried to express it, if my\\nmemory is not at fault, as a kind of quiet music playing in the\\nback of the mind. That is not very definite; but one under-\\nstands how, when music stops, existence abruptly “comes to\\nearth”—provided one has been enjoying the music! “Com-\\npanionship” would have been too personal and shapely a word\\nfor William James; the vague elevation of music was nearer\\nhis sense of the divine as a factor in consciousness or subcon-\\nsciousness. But the music is addressed to the mind it inhabits,\\nand to many this presence takes companionly form, without\\nany of the palpable intrusions of human comradeship. It\\nmeans, at least, “He is there”; and because of this, my solitude\\n192 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\ncan never be deserted and insignificant. This inward presence\\nof God is a continual invitation to greatness in what is intrin-\\nsically small, a reminder of the unlimited possibility of the\\nlimited human person, a dignifying of the commonplace, a\\nmusic?—yes, but a magical music into which one can feed the\\ndisharmonies of plain living and hear them blended into a\\nstrange, unbelievable grandeur of silent sound. The outer\\nworld has its own unremitting summons to heroic action; the\\ninner presence of God has tempted souls here and there into\\nretreat from these outer demands, and then they have lost that\\npresence; its true function is not to compete with the outer\\nclaims and interests (as Mr. Otto fears), but rather to abet\\nthem by raising the soul to the level of the greatest external\\ndemand. To lose God would leave the human self measuring its\\nsole strength against the tasks of history—a Bruno or a Joan\\nof Arc alone before the powers and the fagots. It seemed to\\nthem that they were not alone. For the pure love of man or of\\njustice, others have done as much. Yet there is here also, I\\nthink, a real difference.\\n\\nAt the lowest terms, is the issue not something like this—\\nwhether the world we live in has or has not a meaning? If it\\nhas, then the méaning of the whole may invade the part, and\\nour individual lives may also have a meaning? If it has not, its\\nmeaninglessness infects us also, and all our doings; unless we\\ndecline to think. And if the world as a whole has a meaning,\\nthere is one who entertains that meaning, there is God.\\n\\nI find it easy to understand how men may come to doubt\\nthe existence of God. I find it less easy to understand how the\\nvalue of God can be doubted, if he exists. I surmise that Mr.\\nOtto\\'s difficulty is that he looks too narrowly for that value; he\\nmisses it because it is too obvious and pervasive. The word God\\nis short and thuddy; it suggests a finite knob of existence\\nsomewhere, doing finite things. These finite things necessarily\\nintrude upon and displace other finite things; and Mr. Otto\\nfinds it desirable that they should be ruled out of the reckon-\\ning, and we men left squarely to our own devices, which, he\\nbelieves (with a sanguineness, I suspect, not born of experi-\\nence) will be found sufficient. He reads history as the steady\\ndisplacement of the work of this interfering God—as it largely\\nAPPENDIX 193\\n\\nis—and looks to the inevitable end of the series of subtractions\\nfrom any finite quantity. I find myself much in accord with Mr.\\nOtto\\'s feeling about divine intrusions. I see why he is bothered\\nwhen Mr, Wieman singles out a phase of the social order, a\\nperfectly genuine phase, and calls it God. Whatever is a\\nprocess among other processes, a finite factor in the living mesh\\nof being, may have strong analogies with the divine life; but\\nunless it casts its redeeming quality into the whole of things,\\nor derives it therefrom, it falls short of what we mean by God.\\nBut Mr. Otto seems to me to overlook the comprehensive and\\ntherefore non-intrusive work of God, as the source of meaning\\nin the whole sum of things, and hence in the motives of the\\nsoul.\\n\\nAnd on this account he appears mistaken in supposing that\\nthe extension of human sway over the former domain of the\\nfinite works of God has involved a displacement of the center\\nof the meaning of God. As I read history, it seems to me that\\nwe feel today much more akin to our primitive ancestors in\\nreligion than we used to; and one of my queries of the two\\ntheistic conversers is, why it is, with all their faith in experi-\\nence as a source of instruction, they have made so little use of\\nthose strands of religious experience which unite sophisticated\\nmodernity with its original sources. For those who first con-\\nceived God or the divine were not wholly off the target. And\\nwhile the early intuitions of the race, continually reborn, have\\nno authoritative value, neither are they to be ignored; they\\nrestore our sense of proportion, and the major things stand out\\nclear. Given the indispensable critical sense, determined, in\\nMr. Wieman’s vigorous words, to “extricate the existence of\\nGod from all the crudity, fallibility, and folly of our beliefs\\nabout God,” we can with the more assurance gain from ele-\\nmental belief its endless instruction.\\n\\nEspecially to one who finds God evanescent, and the idea of\\nGod battling, there is perennial cause of wonder in the ease\\nwith which simple folk and children get the idea of God; and\\nhardly less in the fact that the idea they get has almost nothing\\nin common with the pictorial caricatures usually attributed to\\nthe infant mind. Here, for example, are some low-caste\\nIndians, boatmen of Bengal, illiterate and untutored except by\\n194 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nway of certain traditional songs. These boatmen, setting their\\nsails before sunrise to catch the early wind, sing—or used to\\nsing:\\n\\nI ama lamp afloat on the water ;\\n\\nAt what ghat didst Thon set me afloat? . . .\\n\\nO Friend, End of all endless movement,\\n\\nHow many bends of the river are still before me?\\n\\nAnd with what call wilt Thou reveal thyself to me?\\n\\nThou wilt take me from the water,\\n\\nAnd there, under the protection of thy arm,\\n\\nWilt extinguish the burning of the whole long journey!\\n\\nWhere, in this sensitive and intimate feeling of a Thou in the\\nworld, does one find a trace of those silly anthropomorphisms\\nso glibly attributed to the simple of the world in their thoughts\\nof God? There is imagery here; but the singer knows it for\\nwhat it is, and the symbols drop off from the living center of\\nhis conception, What is that center? The ultimate power of the\\nworld, in the attitude of solicitous individual care for his own\\ncreatures. God is good, as love is good; and in that goodness\\nadmonishing to righteousness and devotion. But there is here\\nno weight of correcting and chastening holiness.\\n\\nThe picture is unfinished on the ethical side. Listen, then, to\\nthe voice of another primitive spirit. After quoting the words\\nof the prophet, “The voice of him that cricth in the wilderness,\\nprepare ye the way of the lord,” Karl Barth says, “This is the\\nvoice of our conscience, telling us of the righteousness of God.\\n- . . What it tells is no question, no riddle, no problem, but a\\nfact—the deepest, innermost, surest fact of life: God is right-\\neous.” I say this is the utterance of a primitive, intuitive\\ntherefore dogmatic, streak in Barth; a perception of the\\noriginal mystic in him, before he had been wholly persuaded\\nby that gnarled, intricate and unhappy philosophic genius,\\nKierkegaard, to distrust his own direct insight into the truth of\\nthings.\\n\\nSuch utterances, whether of the Bengalese baiil or of the\\nSwiss pastor-theologian, are not, of course, to be accepted\\nmerely because they come out of a brave soul\\'s volcanic inner\\ncertitude, somehow continuous with the inner lava of the world.\\nAPPENDIX 195\\n\\nBut they do put theses before us, invite corroboration or rejec-\\ntion from our own inner voices, compel review of our sources\\nof knowledge, and remind us, in the midst of our reasonings,\\nwhat the word God has meant to the race.\\n\\nGod has meant responsible creative power, individual solici-\\ntude, the dominance of moral law over every other law of\\nhuman destiny—the complete rebuke of the pretense of natural\\nimmensities to be supreme in their enveloping indifference. God\\nmeans, not a partial inner aspect of nature, but the thorough-\\ngoing subordination of nature to a greater, albeit non-intrusive,\\nspiritual power. To say God is “All” or that he is “Absolute”\\nor “Infinite” might be accurate—I think so—but it would be\\nphilosophic language, and immediately excite diverting diffi-\\nculties in the obdurate philosophic mind. But at least in all the\\nsturdy common thoughts of God he has been commensurate\\nwith the cosmos; throwing the physical universe as well as the\\nworld of men into the relation of dependence. And at the same\\ntime this supreme reality is capable of personal nearness. God\\nis the embodied paradoxical union of the vast and the intimate.\\nThe word Spirit conveys this paradox.\\n\\nDoes any such Being exist? If not, I am ready to say with\\nMr. Otto there is no God. Though I wholly acknowledge the\\nright of redefinition, I would not wish to apply the word to a\\nlesser entity: I would stand with Mr. Macintosh in preferring\\nto put the existence of God into question rather than avoid that\\nquestion by moderating the significance of his being.\\n\\nAnd I would agree with Mr. Otto that to any one who ac-\\ncepts “Nature” as the comprehensive name for the world, and\\nwho judges its hypothetical dispositions toward men by the\\nimpressions of human fortune, the God we have indicated, who\\nin some sense denies the pretenses of Nature, is simply impos-\\nsible. When for the sake of the argument Mr. Otto entertains\\na conception of God, it is a sort of dramatization of the ways\\nof the physical universe, a “transference of manlike character-\\nistics to cosmological nature.” From such a “great Cosmic\\nPower” there is, indeed, no reason to expect good rather than\\nevil. And he is right also, I believe, in judging that the case is\\nnot improved by conceiving the substance of Nature as the\\nthought of a divine mathematician.\\n196 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nOnly, God bas never meant to common humanity the mere\\ninner animation of the natural machine. God has meant an\\ninner life of Nature, but also so much a mastering supplement\\nof Nature that appearances may be reversed, and physical\\ndeath itself the prelude of further life. The speculations grow-\\ning out of physical science are intensely relevant, but they are\\nthe mere beginning of the task. Their chief yield, so far, as\\nMr. Macintosh well points out (page 59), is that some of the\\nold caveats against faith have been withdrawn, and that in\\nsome quarters it is possible to see how physical processes may\\nbe informed by thought and purpose without ceasing to be\\ntruly physical in behavior. So far, there is the mere fringe of\\nGod, a possibility of God; one may have all this and not have\\nGod.\\n\\nMr. Whitehead’s God, referred to by Mr. Macintosh, has in\\nhis conception much more of the true measure of the primitive\\nidea. Whitehead’s bold and wide-reaching speculative structure\\nshows the way thought must go to reach adequacy. He is\\nradically dissatisfied with that pure-mathematical conception\\nof Nature, somewhat violently thrusts back into Nature the\\nqualities of experience—the stone which the quantitative\\nbuilders rejected—and then calls on a God-process, distinct\\nfrom the causal process, to weave these qualities, as “eternal\\nentities,” into the pattern of events. God decorates the iron\\ntrellis of causality with his roses; but power still lies with the\\nquantitative thrust of cause and effect; and this finite deity is\\nstill less than what God has meant to men. It is an “approach,”\\na magnificent approach; not yet an arrival.\\n\\nBut after all, is this not the business of thought—to\\napproach God, not to prove him? What can we expect of\\nexperience, external experience, well mulled over, except adum-\\nbrations of God, intimations of immortality? Mr. Otto is right\\nin saying, These are not God. But he is wrong in saying, These\\nare not signs of God or even, moments of God\\'s being. Is this\\nnot what Mr. Wieman has: an approach to God, and one of the\\nmost necessary and important of all approaches, through social\\nexperience? What he has—so long as he draws no line around\\nit, saying This is all—does not negate the rest of God\\'s being.\\nAPPENDIX 197\\n\\n“God is much more,” says Mr. Wieman, “than what I say\\nabout him.”\\n\\nThe exhilarating feature of the present moment is that men\\nare thinking new thoughts about God, because they are ap-\\nproaching him from different quarters, through various avenues\\nof experience, That this comes about by premature despair of\\nthe way of thought is of little consequence: the two halves of\\nthe complete method will meet, as they do in Mr. Macintosh’s\\nargument. The important thing is that overt experience is the\\nway of renewal and novelty in our grasp of the eternal. This\\nis eminently true of Mr. Wieman’s thought.\\n\\nMy present impression is that Mr. Wieman’s God is rather\\nbadly put together. He is composed of a process, having a\\ndistinctive pattern, as promoting mutuality—a process of in-\\nteraction, hence presupposing interacting elements—and a set\\nof possibilities, not visibly attached to anything. My personal\\nfeeling is—and I am sensible of very imperfect mastery of the\\nconception—that if we hold to Mr. Wieman’s ideal that God\\nshall be knowable as other things are knowable, these possibil-\\nities can only exist as they are contemplated by some mind.\\nAnd if we are to bring a mind into the picture, the process\\nwhich is making for mutuality would better be brought into\\nthe same mind, where it could work intentionally, and not live\\nin the uncomfortable limbo of interaction between entities that\\nmight separate and leave it wandering in the universe like a\\nlost soul.\\n\\nI surmise that Mr. Wieman’s whole argument would profit\\nif he could organize the working elements of his divine being\\nwithin the focus of a self. But I greatly respect his indisposi-\\ntion to capitulate to the ambiguous word “personality.” He was\\naccused in one of the early papers of balancing between per-\\nsonality and impersonality like a tight-rope walker, an accusa-\\ntion which was later withdrawn. But I would venture to revive\\nit as an element of praise. Our notions of personality are so\\nrestricted that they need always to be corrected by the notions\\nof impersonal law, thinking of God as the moral order of the\\nuniverse ; and impersonal law, in turn, needs correction by per-\\nsonality. I believe that there is a true notion of personality\\n198 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\nwhich will include them both. But meantime, if Mr. Wieman\\nuses now one and now the other element, he is but exemplifying\\nby the routes of a nobly candid empiricism that dialectical\\ncharacter of our predicates of God, so much in evidence in the\\nthought of Kierkegaard, Barth and Brunner.\\n\\nAnd agreeing as I do with Mr. Otto that he has no God in\\nthe proper sense of the word, I should like to convince him that\\nhe, too, has an approach to one. His feeling of oneness with\\nthe endless procession of living forms, and of community with\\nthe friendly all-sustaining earth, wherein the human spirit is\\nlifted above pettiness and distraction; at the same time chas-\\ntened by the true grandeur of the uncomprehended which\\nremains forever the undisclosed secret of the world—I would\\nnot spoil the splendid integrity of this mood by trying to draw\\nit into another frame. But I believe most earnestly that com-\\nmunity is the right word, and spells a relation of kind with\\nkind. I will not attribute even a subconscious God to Mr. Otto;\\nbut I will say that I come under the spell of his feeling, and in\\nso doing touch the near edge of what I call God.\\n\\nTo me the answer to the question, Is there a God? is also a\\nmatter of experience, but of the simple and primitive sort. It is\\nnot the projection of deepest wants on distant clouds; for it is\\nthe very meaning of objectivity. It is God that gives Nature its\\nsecure character as something other than my private vision.\\nDeeper than my interaction with human fellows, which is occa-\\nsional, is my interaction with Nature, which is continual: and\\nin interacting with it, I am being acted upon, am being made.\\nBy what? By whatever can make a self; by my Other Self,\\ninalienably present. The wide reaches of the universe are\\ndrawn together in this knot, at the focus of self-consciousness ;\\nand as I find myself, so I find therewith an immediate sense\\nof God. God is the heart of Fact; and with this primary Fact\\nappears my first Duty, to come out of my subjectivity and\\nconverse with him.\\n\\nThis is the merest beginning of the knowledge of God, far\\nJess than that expressed by the Bengal singers or by Barth’s\\nreading of conscience; but it has in it the germ, the primitive\\naffirmation, upon which further experimental knowledge can\\ngrow. To this center, all the various “approaches” bring their\\nAPPENDIX 199\\n\\ncontributions; on it build the visions of the prophets and the\\nmediators.\\n\\nWith it also mingles in the course of history an abundance of\\nhuman error and subjective illusion. And when I think how the\\nsecret fears of good men still make of God, now and then, an\\nunapproachable mystery, a moral tyrant or a vindictive legal-\\nist, and how, mistaking for loyalty their timorous subjection to\\nthese dour dreams, they still impose their mood, through\\npolicies of exaction and exclusion, upon many of their kind, I\\nam at moments tempted to feel that Mr. Otto, if not quite right,\\nmay be nearer right than any of us.\\n\\nBut of course he is not! For the alternative is not as we\\nmade it. It is not a choice between a bad God, spoiled by sub-\\njective complexes, and no God at all. It is a choice between\\nan imperfect God and the true God—between a God who is\\nthe shadow of our infirmities, cast on the clouds of the nether\\ndeep, and the God whose voice is the speech of the world’s\\nhope. I take heart to believe that after the earthquake and the\\nfire, and the just negations that follow, “God is not in them”\\n—there will be widely heard the still, small voice.\\n\\nThe University of Wisconsin\\nMadison\\nDepartment of Philosophy\\n191 Bascom Hall\\nApril 4, 1983\\n\\nDear Professor Hocking:\\n\\nFor nearly a month I have hesitated to write to you about\\nyour critical review in The Christian Century, of the book\\nIs There a God? I wanted my enthusiasm to cool down some-\\nwhat. The earlier impression, however, persists. I have just\\nnow once more reread the review, and its virtues, previously\\nappreciated, still work upon me. There seems to be no good\\nreason for waiting any longer.\\n\\nIt is not my purpose to discuss any differences with you, or\\nindeed to refer to any issue or issues. In the matter of that\\nthere is but one part of your criticism which I incline to reject\\n200 THE COMING WORLD CIVILIZATION\\n\\noutright, and that has to do with another, not myself. For the\\nrest, agree or disagree, you impel me to further observation\\nand study, to meditation—and I had almost said prayer, The\\nfacts adumbrated are very rich and I have no doubt that I shall\\nhereafter find myself, because of what you have said, more\\ndeeply involved in the problem than heretofore.\\n\\nWhat remained and remains most graphically present in my\\nmind is the way the review was done—the fairness of state-\\nment, the completely adequate understanding of the conflict,\\nthe warmth and color of the statement itself. In this art of\\nuniting material and form in writing—surely one of the most\\ndifficult arts—you presented, so it seems to me, an example in\\nthis paper which is not often achieved even when the under-\\ntaking is far more important than any review of a book could\\nbe. Some of your sentences are so weighted and at the same\\ntime poetic, that I have repeated them for other ears as well as\\nmy own, One cannot tell: I may yet end by becoming so\\nfamiliar and enamoured with the sheer rhythm of them as to\\nfeel that I understand what is meant by “the God whose voice\\nis the speech of the world’s hope.” Stranger things have hap-\\npened in philosophy.\\n\\nWell, feeling stimulated by your thought and inwardly\\nwarmed by your style, you will forgive me, I hope, for saying\\nso as frankly as I have.\\n\\nVery sincerely yours,\\n(signed) M.

It contains\\ndivine words emanating from the lips of Lord Krishna. This great\\nepic is an eloquent proof of the observation. As a scripture, this\\nBook embodies the supreme spiritual mystery and secrets. Its\\nstyle is so simple and elegant that with a little study one can\\neasily follow the structure of its words, yet the thoughts behind\\nthose words are so deep and abstruse that even for life time,\\n\\nconstant study of this Book may not show an end of it.\\n\\n‘The Bhagavad Gita’ is an unfathomable ocean of wisdom. It\\nis a bottomless sea containing endless strate of meanings. Just\\nas a diver diving deep in the sea lays his hands on precious gems,\\nsimilarly diving deeper and deeper into the secrets of this Book,\\nthe seeker goes on discovering more and more piles of\\nextraodrdinary gems of thoughts and ideas.\\n\\n‘The Bhagavad Gita’ is a part of the Mahabharata, but even\\nthen it has its own identity, which has made it more prominent\\nthan the Mahabharata. It may look to be just a narration of the\\nhappenings of the war between Kauravas and Pandavas, but it\\nis the philosophy of life, expressed from the lips of Lord Krishna,\\naddressed to the warrior Arjuna, defining following ideas :\\n\\n(i) Facing your enemies in a war is an asupicious and especial\\n\\n(ii) The Lord alone is to be worshipped, and that only by doings\\none’s own duties. Any other worship or duty should be\\nabandoned.\\n\\n(iii) Devotion to the Lord is the mean to which all the rest is\\nsubservient;\\n\\n(iv) The Lord is far different from the whole world and every-\\nthing is under His control. He is the Supreme being, perfect\\nin every excellence.\\n\\n(vy) The human being is obliged to perform his duties without\\nhoping for the fruits which he may get out of his perfor-\\nmance.\\n\\n‘Srimad Bhagavad Gita’ has been translated into several\\nlanguages, and each translation has been reviewed and com-\\nmented in different ways. But this edition of Bhagavad Gita has\\nits own distinction. It contains the original sanskrit text (shloka\\nby shloka) with its translation into Hindi as also in English. We\\nhope that this edition will enlighton not only those readers who\\nread it from religious view point, but also to those who want to\\nstudy this great literary work.\\n\\nIthas been brought out in comparatively bolder type so that\\nit can be easily read by readers of all ages.\\n\\nNew Delhi.\\nAugust 11, 1993 —publishers.\\n(Birth day of Lord Krishna)\\n\\nstorey 3 ora @ Pre sre ares Peres at at ster & we A ot Ferg Sree\\nRear, ae oreara wae saan B we Bl gee Set aie S arHUM Ararat B A\\nrare oret & are Heater oa & ETAT A amretar S ses Area Pes at THs FI\\ngated seer are ‘ofrfaarearr car rar &\\n\\nwen — sesat & Toga ae F ord very dead at teen gale BaF ae Tet\\nrears Cer a veh che Sats ar one A wala S Gor Sarr feng gfftor at Fear\\natc Ba & wret eueR Gran Seer fa ort # ae Pree gar f gfaitoale stat\\nang dydtatee ace ae Har FE othe os are Pore we; ga aK det aE Te TART\\nea 1 ater a antes ve otk esa H GH are S oreaTT A AST GT AA at\\nage af & are qesat ar ea Se cher Rar ara ea Peta S sega ae arr Feat\\nare oe reat Y aoa Weg ae Si ae gates Ft ar Gare ae Rar Ie aT GT\\na Fa Ht Tat St TH\\n\\narea rao at wor Parr BY & fers gates ate rhs era ES | ary TT\\nwre ah a | satan ore Percent Tm TAT Serer aT FS he HET SPT wre Sihgee\\nSHAT S BT SAS VCH H BAT |S eT ara AF Ager F a GET GAA ST Zar\\ntte Rox HS SH atte sen Rear ox Percent a GH 8S Ee gales Se S| rary Age\\n3 Sat an ware aeen Rear atk SAS GT BT ITT FT| a Gales FT meI—\"gaA ae\\nref & srrrean Oa-er a Sm & ote ws StH anges eae B; seg ons oe Get F TAT\\n& at spree t ont ony & aa wort F Ses AR aria &, gale aagat A A\\naera att ebay wa 3 ae Parte, any Tee ore; Teg A Geet of a\\n& tar ¥1 8 at var & aera SST! we SK AT sera Senet ae Wh\\na aut ate 8, ga 7 wet Bl TT Bes, Tae VE; F seer ar Fee A SAT | eT!\\nemfgare Tee Seerdt wer sof att anita; sree Stet AS Ae gee ae, a ait Y rah\\n3 SAT ATT TAY sate eT ater rar | ae Geter Tare ara at a |\\n\\nwar 4 oa & yer—‘oefa! re Y ge et Ae SST, oe GAA aT TAT\\narrait-aar a wis Rar athe ger at Stee fear?” aes F Sera!
